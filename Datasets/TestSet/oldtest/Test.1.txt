I have all the characteristics of a human being 
blood flesh skin hair but not a single clear identifiable emotion except for greed and disgust 
Something horrible is happening inside of me and I don't know why
My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days
I feel lethal on the verge of frenzy
I think my mask of sanity is about to slip
