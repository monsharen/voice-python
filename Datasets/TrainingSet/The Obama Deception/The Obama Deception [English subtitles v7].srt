1
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:11,113
Obama! Obama!
Obama! Obama!

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,713
Contrary to the rumors
that you've heard,

3
00:00:19,748 --> 00:00:21,290
I was not born
in a manger.

4
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,049
I was actually born
on Krypton

5
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:29,940
and sent here
to save the planet Earth.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,889
We cannot continue
to rely only on our military

7
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:39,649
in order to achieve
the national security objectives

8
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:40,280
that we've set.

9
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:41,592
Yes, we can.

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,093
Everybody somewhere
between the ages of 18 to 25

11
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,735
will serve three months
of basic training.

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,408
We've gotta have a civilian
National Security force

13
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:51,160
that's just as powerful,
just as strong.

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,861
Yes, we can!

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,311
Obama's healthcare plan
will include

16
00:00:56,346 --> 00:00:58,169
coverage of all essential
medical services.

17
00:00:58,204 --> 00:00:59,680
Yes, we can!

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,370
Obama is a cruel hoax.

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,740
He works for Wall Street.

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,146
He's an agent
of finance capital.

21
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:08,280
Where did you come up
with the number 700 billion dollars?

22
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,365
Here's the Treasury
spokeswoman's quote:

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,820
"It's not based on
any particular data point.

24
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,160
We just really wanted to come up
with a really big number."

25
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:18,929
To Democrats and Republicans
who've opposed this plan,

26
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:22,100
I say,
step up to the plate.

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,965
A few members
were even told

28
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:28,000
that there would be martial law
in America if we voted "no".

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,197
Secretary Henry Paulson
is no George Washington.

30
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:36,412
I don't think anyone questions,
Mr. Kashkari,

31
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:38,900
that you're working hard.

32
00:01:40,221 --> 00:01:43,665
Our question is,
"Who are you working for?"

33
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:48,976
Obama pledged
that he would resume

34
00:01:49,048 --> 00:01:51,381
the Security and Prosperity
Partnership talks

35
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:54,848
between Mexico and Canada
that President Bush initiated.

36
00:01:54,883 --> 00:01:57,220
The old boss is starting
to look a lot like the new boss.

37
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,192
Robert Gates is gonna remain
on the job

38
00:01:59,222 --> 00:02:02,071
as Defense Secretary
for at least a year.

39
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:04,220
Plenty of sources
knew about this meeting,

40
00:02:04,255 --> 00:02:06,413
uh, told us
and others that

41
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:09,670
it was at Hillary Clinton's house,
but clearly it wasn't.

42
00:02:11,903 --> 00:02:15,980
We've gotta give them a stake
in creating the kind of world order

43
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,630
that I think all of us
would like to see.

44
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,930
We see you causing a depression
so you can blow out the economy

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,963
and consolidate it
and bankrupt it.

46
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,121
We know that you are
enemies of free humanity

47
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:30,418
and we are here
standing against your tyranny.

48
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,421
The Obama Deception.

49
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:41,306
The truth strikes back.

50
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:54,069
Barack is like
the manager of Burger King.

51
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:57,458
All presidents are,
including Bush.

52
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,935
It's like this:
When your fries are cold,

53
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,320
if your burger's
not done right,

54
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,589
you go back to Burger King,
<i>America</i>,

55
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,280
or your government,
and you say,

56
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,881
"My burger's cold.
I want new fries."

57
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:18,192
First, you go to the cashier.
That's the courts.

58
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,640
You argue
to the courts.

59
00:03:22,064 --> 00:03:25,670
The courts, if you can't get no justice
with the cashier, you say,

60
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,457
"Let me see the manager."

61
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,580
"I want to go
to the Supreme Court."

62
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,455
"I want
to see the President."

63
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,944
The manager comes out.

64
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,874
"Hi.
What can I do for you?"

65
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,560
Now the manager can override
the decisions of the cashier.

66
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:46,520
But you never get to see
the franchise owner of Burger King.

67
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:49,204
If you really have
a problem with your burger,

68
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,488
you need to go
see the franchise owner.

69
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,824
We need to go to the top,
or to the bottom.

70
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,649
We need to go to where
the real architecture of government is,

71
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:06,292
and it's not in a president.

72
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:09,282
It's in
a global scheme.

73
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:13,650
Politics in America today
is identical to pro-wrestling.

74
00:04:15,084 --> 00:04:16,819
And what I mean
by that is,

75
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:20,520
in front of the cameras and
the public we all hate each other.

76
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:22,983
I'm gonna kick
my opponents butt.

77
00:04:23,018 --> 00:04:25,455
I'm gonna wail him
from here to high water

78
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,700
and beat the crap out of him.

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,309
Yet behind the scenes
we all are friends going out to dinner.

80
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:32,205
- Going to dinner together.
- And, and, and...

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,197
It's all work.

82
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,470
- All intermarried.
- Show business.

83
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,878
It's showbiz.

84
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:38,088
And that's what you have
today in politics.

85
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:41,300
The Democrats and Republicans
aren't really opposed to each other.

86
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:45,240
Left and right mean nothing.
The only thing that counts is,

87
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:46,578
"Are you working
for Wall Street,

88
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:49,709
or are you trying to defend the people
against the financiers?"

89
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,980
It's pretty obvious that there's
some gigantic financial institutions

90
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:58,752
that have been pulling
the strings of politicians

91
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:00,370
in this country
for a long time.

92
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,307
And, just the fact that
we have it set up

93
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:05,567
where they can donate
millions of dollars

94
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:07,950
to these guys' funds,
these guys' campaigns...

95
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,902
I mean, how do we not
expect it all to go bad?

96
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:17,226
America in 2009
was desperate for change.

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,140
The past eight years
had been a disaster.

98
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,849
Those weapons of mass destruction
have gotta be somewhere.

99
00:05:24,985 --> 00:05:26,291
Maybe under here?

100
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,362
George W. Bush,
who had claimed to be a conservative,

101
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,713
had tripled the size
of the Federal Government,

102
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:43,784
shredded the Constitution,

103
00:05:44,088 --> 00:05:47,320
and destroyed the image
of the United States worldwide.

104
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,924
Nope,
no weapons over there.

105
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:54,754
Endless wars.

106
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,624
Over a million dead Iraqis.

107
00:05:58,377 --> 00:06:01,898
And more than
five thousand dead US troops.

108
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,265
The Patriot Act.

109
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:09,027
Warrantless domestic wiretapping
and spying.

110
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,659
The end
of Posse Comitatus.

111
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:16,543
The rise of the treasonous
North American Union.

112
00:06:18,823 --> 00:06:20,578
A deepening recession

113
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:23,579
sliding towards
total economic collapse.

114
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,799
These factors
and other abuses

115
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:29,067
had the American people
in a state of panic

116
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:32,517
for their future and the very existence
of the United States.

117
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,119
The elite
were in trouble.

118
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,958
The people were beginning
to see through their facade,

119
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:43,214
past their front man and
to the ruling elite behind the throne.

120
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,797
For the first time in US history,
both parties were universally hated.

121
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:52,380
Congress had
a 9% approval rating.

122
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:55,013
The globalist agenda
had stalled.

123
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,759
And then on to the scene came
a man who promised change,

124
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:04,388
change
we could all believe in.

125
00:07:05,296 --> 00:07:10,392
Barack H. Obama promised to end the war
and bring our troops home fast.

126
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:13,094
He pledged
to uphold the Constitution

127
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:14,829
and to stop
the Federal Government

128
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:16,748
from spying
on the American people.

129
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,130
Candidate Obama
told American workers

130
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:21,923
that he was going to get them
out of NAFTA and GATT

131
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,300
and he's already
breaking those promises.

132
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:28,225
In this film,
we will prove

133
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,395
that Obama says one thing
and does another

134
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,492
and that he works for the very same
elite interest that Bush served.

135
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,218
The very interest
engineering the financial collapse

136
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,850
and formation of
a dictatorial world government.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,635
This film is
not about left or right.

138
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:47,900
It is nonpartisan.

139
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:52,370
Our past documentary films are among
some of the most damning indictments

140
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,383
of George W. Bush and his administration
that have ever been made.

141
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,480
If humanity has any hope of
effecting real change for the better,

142
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:06,712
it will not come from
the Madison Avenue false-reality makers

143
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:09,490
who have cast Barak Obama
as the savior of the world.

144
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,000
To alter our course from tyranny to liberty,
to defeat the corrupt elite,

145
00:08:16,035 --> 00:08:17,691
we must get
past the puppets

146
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,197
and confront the real
power structure of the planet.

147
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,964
Now we can see a new world
coming into view.

148
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,900
A world in which
there is the very real prospect

149
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,101
of a New World Order.

150
00:08:31,121 --> 00:08:32,466
Webster Griffin Tarpley

151
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,149
is an accomplished geopolitical analyst
and historian.

152
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,390
Among his scholarly works
are the unauthorized biographies of

153
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,467
George Herbert Walker Bush
and Barack Hussein Obama.

154
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:46,500
Since Bush the Elder made his speech
at the United Nations

155
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,924
back in September of 1990
talking about the New World Order,

156
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,464
I think I've become
confused about

157
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:52,931
what's actually going on
in the world.

158
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,468
The New World Order
is a more palatable name

159
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:59,787
for the Anglo-American
World Empire.

160
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:02,952
It's the planetary domination
of London, New York,

161
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:05,191
Washington,
over the rest of the world.

162
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:08,560
It's hard to get people to join that
or think they have a part in it

163
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,244
if you call it
the Anglo-American World Empire.

164
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:14,752
If you call it the New World Order,
then people in India or

165
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,589
or someplace like that,
or the European Union might think,

166
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,400
"Well, there's something in that
for us too."

167
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,525
But that's not what it is.

168
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,975
It's the Anglo-American
New World Order.

169
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,000
It's really
the Old World Order.

170
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:29,110
It's the British Empire
morphing into the American Empire.

171
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,728
The US-British World Empire
is--is what you're gonna get.

172
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,794
Combines of powerful men

173
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:38,216
have always battled with each other
over the levers of power.

174
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,673
Gerald Celente
is recognized

175
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:45,280
as one of the world's
foremost trends forecasters

176
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,782
and is founder
of the Trends Research Institute.

177
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:50,333
People that are
knowledgeable know

178
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:55,699
that the fight that this country's
been waging since its inception,

179
00:09:56,424 --> 00:10:00,200
is for the central bankers
not to take over the country.

180
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,872
And that's why people like
Andrew Jackson were elected.

181
00:10:04,907 --> 00:10:08,817
And that's why people revere people like
Thomas Jefferson and others.

182
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,491
The takeover's happened
and it's a corporate takeover.

183
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,100
Agents of the Bank of England
attempted to assassinate

184
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,933
President Andrew Jackson
on multiple occasions

185
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:21,534
because of his resistance

186
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:24,843
against a private central bank
being set up in the United States.

187
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,667
And it was something
that Abraham Lincoln warned.

188
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,974
And this is, by the way,
why I believe he was assassinated.

189
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,501
This is
the Lincoln quote:

190
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,342
"The money powers prey upon
the nation in times of peace

191
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,054
and conspire against it
in times of adversity.

192
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:47,118
It is more despotic
than monarchy,

193
00:10:47,153 --> 00:10:52,882
more insolent than autocracy,
more selfish than bureaucracy.

194
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,650
I see in the near future
a crisis approaching that unnerves me

195
00:10:57,685 --> 00:11:02,156
and causes me to tremble
for the safety of my country.

196
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,730
Corporations
have been enthroned.

197
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:10,940
An era of corruption will follow
and the money power of the country

198
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,617
will endeavor
to prolong its reign

199
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:16,978
by working upon
the prejudices of the people

200
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,853
until the wealth is aggregated
in a few hands

201
00:11:21,496 --> 00:11:24,018
and the Republic
is destroyed."

202
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,421
Wall Street
has killed Main Street.

203
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,750
So I know how unpopular it is
to be seen as helping banks right now,

204
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,482
especially when everyone is suffering
in part from their bad decisions.

205
00:11:36,517 --> 00:11:37,970
I promise you,
I get it.

206
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:43,220
Up until about the Kennedy assassination
and the beginning of the war in Vietnam,

207
00:11:43,255 --> 00:11:45,625
the United States is
a very powerful engine

208
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,828
for world progress.

209
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:49,605
It's the assassinations,
the Kennedy assassination,

210
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,367
and the others
in the 1960s,

211
00:11:51,402 --> 00:11:52,992
the beginning
of the Vietnam war,

212
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:55,600
and the beginning of
the absolute domination

213
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,650
of the Wall Street group
over every other interest.

214
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,300
Nobody else counts except
the Wall Street money masters.

215
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,597
That has now made
the United States into,

216
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:05,859
uh, no longer
a force for progress,

217
00:12:05,894 --> 00:12:07,017
but something
very different.

218
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,774
Often a force for
destruction in the world.

219
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:11,374
The Military Industrial Complex

220
00:12:11,545 --> 00:12:14,988
has taken over the country
along with the Wall Street gang.

221
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,200
If you look also
at the people

222
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:20,072
that Obama has put on
his appointments list,

223
00:12:20,482 --> 00:12:21,860
it's all Wall Street.

224
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:24,140
It's government of Wall Street,
by Wall Street,

225
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:25,481
and for Wall Street.

226
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:29,900
There's nobody from heavy industry,
there's nobody from the auto sector,

227
00:12:29,935 --> 00:12:33,215
nobody from Silicon Valley,
nobody from big oil,

228
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,561
nobody from defense,
no labor,

229
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:39,318
no women, no retirees,
no small business, nothing!

230
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:40,845
It's pure Wall Street.

231
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,895
The only people who have
a voice in Obama's counsels

232
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,660
are Wall Street finance oligarchs.

233
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,674
That's all there is.

234
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:50,541
Nobody else counts
for anything under Obama.

235
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:53,065
It's the most extreme
Wall Street administration

236
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,989
we've ever had.

237
00:12:55,213 --> 00:12:57,559
Before his death,
President Woodrow Wilson

238
00:12:57,594 --> 00:12:59,129
apologized to the public

239
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:01,439
regretting that
he had been deceived

240
00:13:01,474 --> 00:13:03,475
by a group
of international bankers

241
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,087
and the country's financial system
had fallen into their iron grip

242
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,360
via the
Federal Reserve Act of 1913.

243
00:13:09,764 --> 00:13:14,404
Whether sought or unsought,
by the Military Industrial Complex,

244
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:19,537
the potential for the disastrous rise
of misplaced power exists

245
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:20,732
and will persist.

246
00:13:20,772 --> 00:13:22,180
Dwight D. Eisenhower.

247
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:24,199
He warned the people

248
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:28,900
that the Military Industrial Complex
was taking over the country.

249
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:31,200
Only three years
after leaving office,

250
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,520
President Eisenhower's
prophetic warning

251
00:13:33,555 --> 00:13:36,354
concerning the threat posed
to our system of government

252
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:39,310
by the Military Industrial Complex
came to pass.

253
00:13:40,374 --> 00:13:44,110
President John F. Kennedy
had enraged the entire elite network.

254
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:48,460
Now Kennedy was brought in as somebody
who was expected to be a puppet.

255
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:52,818
It was thought that his pro-Nazi father,
Joseph P. Kennedy,

256
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:55,500
the bootlegger,
the speculator,

257
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,047
would guarantee that Kennedy
would be obedient to the establishment.

258
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,263
They thought that
Kennedy was a sex maniac

259
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,632
who could be manipulated
through all of this,

260
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:05,870
but it turned out that
through his personal suffering,

261
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:09,082
Kennedy had discovered
a personal sense of himself

262
00:14:09,117 --> 00:14:11,266
which went beyond
just being a puppet

263
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,716
and he began to think
about things like economic recovery,

264
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,001
world peace,
having a space program,

265
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,999
making deals
with the Soviets,

266
00:14:19,034 --> 00:14:21,391
cutting the Federal Reserve
down to size,

267
00:14:21,426 --> 00:14:22,717
and a whole series of other things.

268
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:27,761
Executive Order number 11110,
signed by President Kennedy,

269
00:14:27,796 --> 00:14:31,034
began the process of abolishing
the private Federal Reserve.

270
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:33,783
Kennedy was also pushing
for real civil rights reform

271
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:37,244
and had begun the process
of pulling the troops out of Vietnam.

272
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:42,597
The last time you had
an actual president was Kennedy.

273
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,249
The oligarchs took
swift and decisive action.

274
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,870
When John Kennedy attempted
to take the government back

275
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:51,280
from the robber barons,

276
00:14:51,315 --> 00:14:52,907
he was brutally murdered.

277
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:57,486
The message to future US presidents
and leaders across the world was clear,

278
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,974
"Do as you're told
or die."

279
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,586
John Fitzgerald Kennedy

280
00:15:02,621 --> 00:15:05,233
was the last true president
of the United States,

281
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:08,080
and until the globalists
are removed from power,

282
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,993
we will never have
another real one.

283
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,037
The other thing about
the American presidency,

284
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:17,220
you've got to remember,
is that this is a puppet post.

285
00:15:17,255 --> 00:15:19,365
It's automatically
gonna be a puppet post.

286
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:21,716
The idea that Obama
is somebody

287
00:15:21,751 --> 00:15:24,021
who's gonna come in
and exercise real authority,

288
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:27,345
when he's obviously been chosen
and given everything

289
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,693
that he's got
by these financiers?

290
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:32,908
Presidents are now little
more than corporate pitchmen

291
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,720
who take
all the political heat

292
00:15:34,755 --> 00:15:36,861
while the controllers
remain in the shadows,

293
00:15:37,013 --> 00:15:38,691
safe from public scrutiny.

294
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,732
Hip-hop icon
KRS One

295
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:44,156
is not just known
for selling millions of albums.

296
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:47,373
He has led a tireless crusade
against youth violence

297
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:49,360
and has been a strong voice
for human rights.

298
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:52,938
If they controlled it before,
what are you...?

299
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:53,650
Why don't...?

300
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:56,777
What makes you think
they're not controlling it now?

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,658
The country was
on the verge of revolution.

302
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,956
They threw
a black man up.

303
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,512
Now we're like this.

304
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,334
They give him the money.

305
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,559
They give him the bundling.

306
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:11,991
They give him vote fraud.

307
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:14,115
They give him
the media whores.

308
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,300
They give him goons.

309
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,885
They even have elected officials
making threats to put people in jail

310
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,294
if they criticize Obama
in public.

311
00:16:21,329 --> 00:16:26,420
All this is the mark of a puppet, uh,
and that means that he is a puppet.

312
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,460
Actually, more of a puppet
than anybody else.

313
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,465
More than a puppet
than Mrs. Clinton would have been.

314
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,898
Even more of a puppet
than--than McCain.

315
00:16:32,933 --> 00:16:37,612
He's the maximum puppet that we've had,
certainly since, since Jimmy Carter.

316
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:40,360
They put a black face
on the New World Order,

317
00:16:40,395 --> 00:16:42,249
and now
we all happy.

318
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,315
KRS ain't buying it.

319
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,855
In the real executive
power structure,

320
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,883
the president serves
the Military Industrial Complex,

321
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,626
itself owned
by the international bankers.

322
00:16:52,869 --> 00:16:54,281
If there's a revolution,

323
00:16:54,316 --> 00:16:57,395
the population just throws out
the Prime Minister or President.

324
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,349
The elite
stays in power,

325
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:02,970
because the public is never aware
of who the real enemy is.

326
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,239
In Evian, France, in 1991,
standing before the Bilderberg Group,

327
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:10,900
the apex of the world government
power structure,

328
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:14,161
David Rockefeller
defined the New World Order

329
00:17:14,196 --> 00:17:16,200
as a system
of world government

330
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,760
serving
the international banking elite.

331
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,523
For decades, the banker-owned media
would attack anyone

332
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:24,154
who dared
to warn the public

333
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:25,813
that a dictatorial
world government

334
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,100
was being constructed
right under their nose,

335
00:17:28,543 --> 00:17:32,545
and that national sovereignty
was being deliberately destroyed.

336
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,885
And now,
after years of denial,

337
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,315
the media and the elite
themselves

338
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:44,000
are proudly announcing
that not only is world government real,

339
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:46,628
but it is the answer
to the financial crisis

340
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,871
that they carefully engineered.

341
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:52,503
Suddenly,
the Wall Street Journal tells us

342
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,437
that the North American Union
is here

343
00:17:54,472 --> 00:17:57,358
and that getting rid of the dollar
for a common currency

344
00:17:57,437 --> 00:17:59,717
with Canada and Mexico
is good?

345
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,335
The Financial Times of London,

346
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:05,700
published by a member
of the Bilderberg Group,

347
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,501
crowed that a dictatorial
world government

348
00:18:08,536 --> 00:18:11,472
had been kept in the shadows
for our own good

349
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,593
and that it was now time
for it to emerge

350
00:18:14,628 --> 00:18:17,465
from behind the curtains
of national security.

351
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,550
White House Chief of Staff,
Rahm Emanuel, stated on record

352
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,968
that they can't let
this crisis go to waste.

353
00:18:24,743 --> 00:18:27,638
You never want
a serious crisis to go to waste.

354
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,689
But what I mean by that:
It's an opportunity to do things

355
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,745
that you think
you could not do before.

356
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,594
And Henry Kissinger,
who gave Barack Obama

357
00:18:36,629 --> 00:18:38,573
his first job
out of college,

358
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,626
told national television
that the economic collapse

359
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:43,900
was a great opportunity
to bring in

360
00:18:43,935 --> 00:18:45,140
the New World Order.

361
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,202
He went on to say that
Barack Obama

362
00:18:47,216 --> 00:18:50,275
was the perfect person
to sell it to the world.

363
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,643
...but he can give a new impetus
to American foreign policy,

364
00:18:55,678 --> 00:19:00,963
partly because the reception of him
is so extraordinary around the world.

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,847
I think his task will be
to develop an overall strategy

366
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:08,392
for America,
in this period,

367
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,781
when really,
a New World Order can be created.

368
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,667
It's a great opportunity.
It isn't just a crisis.

369
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,100
In June of 2006, our team traveled
to Ottawa, Canada

370
00:19:19,135 --> 00:19:21,853
to gather intelligence
on the Shadow Government's agenda

371
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:24,096
for the coming years.

372
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:26,882
- I think that's the Queen.
- It is.

373
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,259
It's the Queen!
It's the Queen!

374
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,000
Investigative journalist
and best-selling author, Daniel Estelin,

375
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:35,150
had been tracking the Bilderberg Group
for more than 16 years.

376
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,989
His moles inside Bilderberg
informed him

377
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:40,980
that the elite were planning

378
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,008
to first run the price of gas up,
to $150 a barrel,

379
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:47,717
unimaginable in 2006.

380
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,846
He also reported that
after suckering the middle class

381
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:52,225
back into the stock market,

382
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,851
the group was going to implode
the sub-prime mortgage market

383
00:19:55,886 --> 00:19:58,017
and destroy public confidence.

384
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,054
Well, one of the things that, you know,
we're getting from this morning's...

385
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:03,150
this afternoon's conference...
this morning's conference,

386
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,265
was about the, uh,
the--the energy crisis, the price of oil.

387
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,844
This, the afternoon conference,
which started about 4 o'clock,

388
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:09,994
4:00 or 4:30...

389
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,199
They were talking about, uh...
One of the American delegates

390
00:20:13,234 --> 00:20:14,910
(I--I wasn't told
who exactly it was)

391
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,384
was talking
about the, uh,

392
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,210
the concern that
the American citizens have had

393
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:21,588
with the, you know,
with the housing prices going down.

394
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,179
So they're not investing
that money.

395
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:24,193
So what they needed
to do is

396
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,952
they needed to create the illusion
that everything is going well.

397
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:29,300
So what they're going to do
over the next year, year and a half,

398
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,991
is to bring the market
back up to 1998-1999 levels.

399
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,524
They're gonna get
all the suckers to invest

400
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:36,322
whatever little money
they have left over,

401
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,220
and that's when they're going
to make the economy bottom drop out.

402
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,810
They need to destroy
the economy because,

403
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:43,400
as we're running out of oil,

404
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,720
when people don't travel
(at least that's what they're saying),

405
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,112
when people don't travel,

406
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:49,089
when people don't have money
they don't travel,

407
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:49,907
they don't spend
any money,

408
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,900
which means you don't waste
a lot of oil and natural gas.

409
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,775
- That's the afternoon scheduled session.
- So how does this source,

410
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,610
I mean just ball park, I mean...
So, you have this source. Is it...?

411
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,756
Well, actually,
there are two people, uh,

412
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:01,100
who are members
of the Bilderberg Club

413
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,225
It's actual members that are...

414
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,625
They are members
of the Bilderberg Club who,

415
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:05,041
for years
and years and years,

416
00:21:05,593 --> 00:21:07,649
have been going and participating
in all the conversations.

417
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:09,400
They have always been
dead-on, always.

418
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,100
And last year, they said
the oil prices are gonna go up to $150.

419
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,340
At the time it was $39.
It went up to $76; basically doubled.

420
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,665
If it doubles again, it's gonna be back
to where these people say

421
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,620
- it is going...
- If they attack Iran, it will hit 150.

422
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,288
Year after year,
Estelin and other reporters

423
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,471
like Jim Tucker,
are able to report

424
00:21:24,506 --> 00:21:27,291
on future events
with stunning accuracy

425
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:31,188
all because they know the agenda
of the Bilderberg Group.

426
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,029
The Bilderberg Group sits at
the top of the world power structure.

427
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,882
125 of the richest
and most influential individuals

428
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,071
on the globe
make up its membership.

429
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,712
From Istanbul, Turkey,
to Chantilly, Virginia,

430
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:51,586
we have tracked
the elusive Bilderberg Group.

431
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,532
Bilderberg always insists
on a media blackout.

432
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,162
By June of 2008,
we had already figured out

433
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:05,098
that Barack Obama
was the elites' puppet of choice.

434
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,738
The national media
claimed

435
00:22:06,766 --> 00:22:08,913
that during the weekend
the Bilderberg Group

436
00:22:08,948 --> 00:22:12,343
was scheduled to meet
that Obama had speaking engagements

437
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:14,547
set for Chicago
and the Midwest.

438
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:15,733
We knew better.

439
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,208
In a classic
bait-and-switch,

440
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:20,501
the Obama Campaign
told the press corp

441
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,642
to get on
Obama's campaign plane

442
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:26,378
and that Obama would join them
on the flight to Chicago.

443
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,550
Campaign staff
then slammed the door shut.

444
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:32,363
The fawning press
had been shanghaied

445
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:36,157
as Obama's campaign aircraft
lifted off without Obama.

446
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,897
Robert, why were we not told
about this meeting

447
00:22:39,932 --> 00:22:41,792
and that the Senator
wouldn't be on our plane

448
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:45,290
until the doors were shut
and we were about to taxi to take-off?

449
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,775
Again, uh...

450
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,286
We had a desire...

451
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:53,458
Senator Obama had a desire
to do some meetings.

452
00:22:53,493 --> 00:22:55,646
Others have the desire
to meet with him tonight

453
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:58,390
in a private way
and that's what we're doing.

454
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,896
We set up
these meetings...

455
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:01,740
They're being,
they're being done tonight.

456
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,675
Again, I'm...
I...

457
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,451
Is there more than one meeting?

458
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,670
Is there more than one person
with whom he is...

459
00:23:09,705 --> 00:23:12,137
I'm not gonna get into
all the details of the meetings.

460
00:23:12,854 --> 00:23:14,591
I don't know
that I've got a ton more

461
00:23:15,398 --> 00:23:18,084
different answers
for all of your questions.

462
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:20,230
Obama wasn't going
to Chicago.

463
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,980
He had a meeting
to attend.

464
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,483
A secret meeting.

465
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,806
Initially, it was believed
that the secret meeting

466
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:28,400
took place at
Clinton's Washington DC home.

467
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,965
Obama's spokesman
denied that

468
00:23:29,986 --> 00:23:32,607
but won't confirm
where the former rivals met.

469
00:23:32,642 --> 00:23:35,666
He also declined to comment
on their topics of discussion.

470
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,569
For a day and a half,

471
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,500
the mainstream media
engaged in a wild goose chase

472
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,648
trying to find out
where Hillary and Obama had gone.

473
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:47,900
Three cover stories later,
the corporate press had to admit,

474
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,710
they had no idea
where the two candidates had gone.

475
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,028
And to this day,
Clinton and Obama aren't talking.

476
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,488
Plenty of sources
knew about this meeting,

477
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,562
uh, told us
and others

478
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:02,960
that it was at Hillary Clinton's house,
but clearly it wasn't.

479
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,192
In 2008, the trail led us
to the Westfields Marriott Hotel,

480
00:24:07,227 --> 00:24:09,790
right outside
Washington, DC.

481
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,100
We just flew into
Washington, DC.

482
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,500
We're driving
to the Westfields Marriott.

483
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,293
Tomorrow, the hotel's closed
throughout the week

484
00:24:19,328 --> 00:24:21,249
into the weekend
for the Bilderberg Group meeting.

485
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,272
We're gonna check in
the night before.

486
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:24,708
They're gonna
kick us out tomorrow.

487
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,310
So, we're going directly into
the belly of the beast.

488
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:31,166
The hotel will be filled with
at least five spy agencies:

489
00:24:31,576 --> 00:24:37,004
CIA, Defense Intelligence, Mossad, um...
European Union Security.

490
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,247
We checked in to the Westfields Marriott
48 hours before hotel guests

491
00:24:42,282 --> 00:24:45,635
were scheduled to be thrown out
ahead of the annual meeting.

492
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,944
The building was nestled in the heart
of the Military Industrial Complex

493
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:54,168
with the National Reconnaissance Office
and Raytheon,

494
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:56,070
just a stone's throw away.

495
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,783
The plan tonight is
to try to not get arrested,

496
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,308
dodge the security,
get in there,

497
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:14,895
get some--some footage of the elite
arriving in the morning

498
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,901
because some arrive before
they officially lock it down,

499
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:18,380
and then getting
out of the building.

500
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:19,399
That's our plan.

501
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:21,280
I'm also gonna be, um,
getting a call

502
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:25,100
by a international
syndicated radio show,

503
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,788
<i>Coast To Coast AM</i>
with George Noory.

504
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:29,561
And, all week, he's getting
briefings from me every night,

505
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,502
uh, about things
as they develop.

506
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,158
George,
we're sitting here in the room.

507
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:45,298
As the phone rings
with your producer Tom Danheiser

508
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,453
to put me on,
the fire alarm goes off.

509
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,169
So everybody
is exiting the building.

510
00:25:50,204 --> 00:25:51,300
I know
this is a setup.

511
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,330
They timed it
exactly when this happened.

512
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,120
Open the door.

513
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
I want them
to hear the fire alarm.

514
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,260
Open the door.

515
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:02,400
I want people to hear this live...
to the 16 million people listening.

516
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,656
George,
do you hear that?

517
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,799
Now, now, now,
they're gonna use this as an excuse.

518
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:14,661
The Westfields Marriott
right outside DC in Chantilly.

519
00:26:14,696 --> 00:26:16,409
They want to use this
to flush us outta here.

520
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:17,399
They are very upset.

521
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:18,648
Everybody
that covers Bilderberg

522
00:26:18,773 --> 00:26:21,220
was detained two years ago,
interrogated, screamed at.

523
00:26:21,255 --> 00:26:24,500
They said Bilderberg was upset about me,
wanted to stop us.

524
00:26:24,685 --> 00:26:26,561
This is guaranteed.

525
00:26:26,596 --> 00:26:28,563
Everywhere we go,
we're followed.

526
00:26:28,598 --> 00:26:31,087
We have another hotel across town
as a base of operations.

527
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:34,138
They were there, questioning us,
getting in our faces.

528
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,155
We're being followed everywhere.

529
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,700
I need everybody's support
right now.

530
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,390
I pray to God
they don't try to set me up.

531
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,905
They may have tried to concoct this
in some way to say,

532
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,770
you know, look, they didn't
leave during a fire drill,

533
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:44,720
assessing me, knowing I would
stay and do the interview.

534
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,331
But again, the moment
the phone rang with Tom Danheiser,

535
00:26:48,366 --> 00:26:51,574
the moment the phone rang,
the guys answered it.

536
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,130
I'm standing there.

537
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,900
The alarm goes off.

538
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,698
It's going off right now.

539
00:26:55,733 --> 00:26:57,450
The guests are exiting
the hotel out there.

540
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,553
Of course,
there's no fire.

541
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,864
This is just absolutely insane.

542
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:04,379
I noticed, too, that there was over
a hundred security people here today,

543
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,422
but tonight we got back
and it was a total ghost town.

544
00:27:07,457 --> 00:27:08,565
And this is what's insane:

545
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,838
We have a security guy
walk up to us 30 minutes ago,

546
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:14,197
about 25 minutes ago,
before this happened,

547
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,200
and said,
"What are you guys doing?"

548
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,430
We said, "We're just walking around
checking out the artwork in the hotel,"

549
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,996
which we actually
were admiring and,

550
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:20,560
but we were also going
around getting some footage.

551
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,387
And, you know, they said,
"Well, no cameras allowed."

552
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:23,066
We said, "Fine."

553
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,695
And then he said,

554
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:27,334
"Yeah, we had somebody
do a fire alarm a few weeks ago."

555
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,235
And me and Rob,
my camera guy, we're going,

556
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,690
"Why is he telling us
about a fire alarm?"

557
00:27:31,035 --> 00:27:32,199
I forgot that part,
George.

558
00:27:32,228 --> 00:27:33,670
These bastards
have done this.

559
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,186
I don't know how.

560
00:27:34,217 --> 00:27:36,410
They're planning to try
to set us up or something.

561
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,330
But this is incredible.

562
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,659
We are here in the middle of this
right now, George.

563
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,937
Stay there.
Keep it locked.

564
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,871
Let's go.

565
00:28:21,977 --> 00:28:23,340
Let's get
out of here now, Richard.

566
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,952
Don't screw around anymore.

567
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,420
We got out of here
at exactly the right time.

568
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,517
- Is this the way out?
- Yeah.

569
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,536
Yeah, we got
a car right behind us.

570
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,951
We made about, what,
five turns

571
00:28:55,982 --> 00:28:58,100
and the sixth turn,
the same car's following us?

572
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,337
And now it looks like
he's following us into a...

573
00:29:00,372 --> 00:29:01,889
He came out of
Bilderberg.

574
00:29:01,924 --> 00:29:02,900
He came out of
the Westfields.

575
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,790
He's being
a little bit subtle but...

576
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,537
Not too...

577
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,242
There he is.

578
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:08,980
- That's him over there in the blue car.
- that green, ah... yeah.

579
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,627
Yeah.

580
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:29,136
We're headed back
to the Marriott here

581
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:32,627
in Chantilly, Virginia,
the scene of Bilderberg 2008.

582
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:35,270
We've successfully infiltrated
the last day and a half inside.

583
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,600
Got out
with some great stuff.

584
00:29:36,804 --> 00:29:37,887
We've been tailed.

585
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:40,038
And now
we're going back to...

586
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:44,828
cover the dignitaries,
the elitists, as they arrive.

587
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,059
And right now
is the prime time for them

588
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,557
to start arriving
for the next 3 or 4 hours.

589
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:49,152
We took about
a 30 minute break.

590
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,620
I'm sure we missed a few
but it doesn't matter,

591
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:54,062
because we've got scores of people
that just organically are listeners,

592
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,162
Infowarriors that are out here
taking action.

593
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:09,094
Yeah!

594
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,483
And we're gonna be out here
for the next three days

595
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,487
while you try to chart
the future of our destiny.

596
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:22,630
We're taking
our destiny back!

597
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:25,723
You're not our gods
or our masters!

598
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,235
We witnessed at least seven convoys
of armed Secret Service entering

599
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,819
the Westfields Marriott
and internal sources confirmed

600
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:41,345
that both candidates did attend at least
one meeting inside the conference.

601
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,722
While the Bilderberg Group
was 100% successful in 2008

602
00:30:47,757 --> 00:30:50,559
at keeping their name
out of the mainstream media,

603
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:52,228
they did not fare
as well

604
00:30:52,263 --> 00:30:55,206
when it came to
the exploding independent press.

605
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,541
During the entire two day event,
anti-New World Order protesters

606
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:03,697
and alternative media
encircled the hotel.

607
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,648
You are being exposed
everywhere!

608
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,370
From David Rockefeller!

609
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:10,718
From John Edwards!

610
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:11,827
From Bill Clinton!

611
00:31:11,862 --> 00:31:14,919
Your game of secrecy
is over!

612
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:18,687
...you piece of filth!

613
00:31:19,023 --> 00:31:20,244
You piece of trash!

614
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,071
There's Bernanke, man!

615
00:31:22,106 --> 00:31:23,921
Bernanke,
you're going down!

616
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:33,200
Obama,
we know you're here, Obama!

617
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:35,687
You cleared your schedule
for the next three days!

618
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:37,501
We know
you're in Virginia!

619
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,764
Arch-criminals!

620
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,201
New World Order scum!

621
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:44,471
We are not your slaves,
you scum!

622
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,996
Brave Americans came from
all over the United States

623
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:52,608
and bullhorned the main conference hall
at close range

624
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:55,509
as the global power brokers
schemed inside.

625
00:31:55,537 --> 00:31:56,402
Freedom!

626
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:58,147
You are criminals!

627
00:31:58,426 --> 00:31:59,931
You control
the central banks!

628
00:31:59,966 --> 00:32:01,353
You control the currency!

629
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:05,810
And you're turning our beautiful
country and world into a nightmare!

630
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,672
The global elite
are desperate

631
00:32:07,707 --> 00:32:10,226
to keep their organizational
meetings a secret.

632
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,585
They are keenly aware

633
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,460
that if the population
discovers that policy is being

634
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,545
developed covertly
by powerful special interests,

635
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,071
the people will revolt.

636
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,213
It is our duty
to expose these criminals.

637
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:26,091
It's a criminal act
under federal law

638
00:32:26,126 --> 00:32:28,557
for federal officials
to have private meetings

639
00:32:28,592 --> 00:32:35,761
to discuss world policy, uh,
with non-federal workers.

640
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:40,300
So everybody from the State Department,
Treasury Department, White House,

641
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,582
Defense Department
and others who show up,

642
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:45,366
as they always do...

643
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,300
They're committing a criminal act
simply by being here

644
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,033
to attend a secret meeting
with officials from other countries

645
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:56,181
to--to discuss US policy
in the world.

646
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,234
So, literally, it's a criminal act
and every newspaper, every broadcaster,

647
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:06,274
has a patriotic duty
to expose these scum

648
00:33:07,132 --> 00:33:10,055
and the, uh,
evil they project.

649
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,741
The election primaries served
as a great diversion

650
00:33:13,776 --> 00:33:16,042
while the true future course
of the nation

651
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,199
was being set
behind closed doors.

652
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,100
You've got, obviously,
the Bilderberg Group founded by

653
00:33:22,135 --> 00:33:25,614
the former Nazi, uh,
Prince Bernard of Holland.

654
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:28,136
You've got
the Trilateral Commission,

655
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,776
founded by David Rockefeller's
Zbigniew Brzezinski.

656
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,529
They're the ones who ran
the Carter Administration.

657
00:33:33,564 --> 00:33:35,232
Everybody in
the Carter administration,

658
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:38,255
from Carter and Mondale
and Volker and Brzezinski,

659
00:33:38,291 --> 00:33:40,629
were all members
of the Trilateral Commission.

660
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,868
Founding member of rap sensation
Public Enemy, Professor Griff,

661
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:47,371
gave us his view
of the Obama phenomenon.

662
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,092
Barack Obama's been given a pass
by the bluebloods.

663
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:53,053
He's been given the okay
by certain secret societies

664
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:54,380
for them
to let him in.

665
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,778
I truly believe, um, imperialism
and fascism needs a facelift.

666
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,590
And the facelift
is gonna have to be black.

667
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,291
And the--the reason
why I believe that?

668
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:06,889
It's simply because, um...

669
00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:09,431
I think they're trying
to go into Africa.

670
00:34:09,466 --> 00:34:10,638
Well, they're already
in Africa,

671
00:34:10,774 --> 00:34:13,236
but they want to totally control
all the natural minerals

672
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:15,342
that they're going to need
to carry themselves

673
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:18,503
into the 21st,
22nd and 23rd centuries.

674
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,598
Are you following me?
So, I think they have to go through

675
00:34:22,633 --> 00:34:26,715
a phase of galvanizing
the masses of dark-skinned people.

676
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,819
They truly believe
that change needs to come,

677
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:31,535
but the change
that they are talking about

678
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,045
is not necessarily change for the better
as far as the masses of the people.

679
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,992
It's probably
a better change for them.

680
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:40,910
It's not gonna change for us,
the little man on the totem pole.

681
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,389
And no one
looks at the agenda.

682
00:34:42,424 --> 00:34:44,610
- No one looks at the agenda.
- As long as he positions himself right,

683
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:47,388
have the right tie on,
have the right smile,

684
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:50,635
repeats the slogans
over and over,

685
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:54,710
and drives it, and drives it home,
the average, the average American

686
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,100
is just gonna swallow it
hook, line and sinker.

687
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,899
And we don't even know
what the agenda is.

688
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,500
Writing in his 1964 book,
<i>With No Apologies</i>,

689
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,891
Senator Barry Goldwater
said,

690
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,123
"The Trilateral Commission
is intended to be

691
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:10,793
the vehicle
for multinational consolidation

692
00:35:10,828 --> 00:35:14,193
of the commercial and
banking interests by seizing control

693
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,450
of the political government
of the United States.

694
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,550
"The Trilateral Commission represents
a skillful, coordinated effort

695
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,069
to seize control and consolidate
the four centers of power:

696
00:35:24,104 --> 00:35:28,320
political, monetary,
intellectual and ecclesiastical.

697
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:34,097
What the Trilateral Commission intends,
is to create a worldwide economic power

698
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:38,203
superior to the political governments
of the nation-states involved.

699
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:42,636
As managers and creators of the system,
they will rule the future.

700
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,200
Bilderberg issues executive decisions
and prime directives

701
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,057
to its sub-directorates
for implementation.

702
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,071
The Trilateral Commission takes
the Bilderberg Group agenda

703
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:56,160
and executes it
through regional roundtable groups

704
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,440
throughout Europe,
Asia and the Americas.

705
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,349
The Council on Foreign Relations
serves as the managing roundtable group

706
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:04,039
in the United States sector.

707
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,314
The Council on Foreign Relations

708
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:10,489
has dominated every administration
since the days of FDR.

709
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,659
The way in which
they make policy and rule

710
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:19,059
is that they are a
polycentric, oligarchical system.

711
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,310
You have to be
a finance oligarch.

712
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:25,650
Remember, this is not a society
ruled by generals, not by priests,

713
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,309
not by bureaucrats, not by demagogues,
none of those, but by bankers.

714
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,935
Bankers rule, and the bankers
set up these institutions.

715
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,026
They set up things

716
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:38,790
modeled on the Royal Institute
for International Affairs,

717
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:42,460
Chatham House,
and the Milner Roundtable

718
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:45,086
of the period
right after the Boer War.

719
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:47,022
So even
before World War I,

720
00:36:47,057 --> 00:36:49,406
you had the British
setting up these roundtables,

721
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,855
institutes, with publications
and conferences.

722
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,038
And this is
how they make policy.

723
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:57,946
Upon Obama's inauguration,

724
00:36:57,997 --> 00:37:02,211
members of the Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission and CFR,

725
00:37:02,246 --> 00:37:04,442
flooded into
every position of power

726
00:37:04,468 --> 00:37:07,990
in the Executive Branch,
replacing Trilateral Commission

727
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,180
and CFR members,
who previously filled the positions

728
00:37:11,215 --> 00:37:12,970
during
the Bush administration.

729
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,476
When you look at the, uh,
US ruling class,

730
00:37:17,511 --> 00:37:20,094
you'd have to say
that they're a really pathetic bunch

731
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:22,141
of failures and bunglers.

732
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:25,248
They are a miserable excuse
for a ruling class.

733
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:27,174
And that's one of
the big problems we have,

734
00:37:27,207 --> 00:37:31,053
is you go from Clinton
to Bush to Obama.

735
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:34,477
What stays the same is the ruling elite
that gives these puppets

736
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:36,030
the orders
that they act on,

737
00:37:36,065 --> 00:37:40,076
and these orders are wrong-headed,
let's say, to say the least.

738
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:41,507
They are basically bankrupt.

739
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,191
They're gonna to lead
to the collapse of this civilization.

740
00:37:44,226 --> 00:37:48,915
What they're doing is using
the existence of the United States

741
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:51,441
as a formerly
powerful nation-state

742
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:54,607
to act out
their Wall Street fantasies

743
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:57,922
of world of domination
and maintaining their capital structures

744
00:37:57,957 --> 00:38:01,200
and maintaining their system of looting
and this can't be done.

745
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,998
So, the basic question is:
They've hijacked our country

746
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,552
and you've got
to take it back from them.

747
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:08,000
You've got to drive Wall Street
out of the government

748
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,076
and at that point,
you have a reasonable chance

749
00:38:10,111 --> 00:38:11,587
of getting back
to prosperity

750
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,210
and some kind of peace and order
in international affairs.

751
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,895
We had a chance to speak with
economist and author George Humphrey.

752
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:21,019
They have created
a power elite.

753
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:25,200
And we're not talking about your...
the--the millionaire down the street.

754
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,821
You can't even be
a member of their club

755
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:30,469
unless you're
a multi-billionaire.

756
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:35,344
And friends, this is not about
rich versus poor.

757
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,741
This is about
a very, very small handful

758
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:44,000
of--of the worst criminal element
on this planet

759
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:49,756
manipulating and destroying
the good people of this nation

760
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,100
and of this world.

761
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,968
About this Obama, with change,
look at the people he's put in

762
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,282
to mastermind
the economic recovery.

763
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,320
Larry Summers.

764
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:02,960
I love it!

765
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,221
Every time they talk about
Larry Summers,

766
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:07,900
he's always brilliant.

767
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,918
He's another brilliant one.

768
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,829
He's the one that helped
dismantle the Glass-Steagall Act,

769
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:16,898
the banking act that was
put in place in the 1930s

770
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:20,153
so the banks couldn't get... become
the banksters that they've become.

771
00:39:20,188 --> 00:39:23,868
In the 1990s, you had
the beginning of the derivatives bubble,

772
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,807
thanks to people like
Alan Greenspan, Rubin, Summers;

773
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:31,845
a lot of the people who are now back
in the Obama administration.

774
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,399
And the derivatives,
I think,

775
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:36,283
are the centerpiece
of this entire problem today.

776
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,224
These are
the same people:

777
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:41,051
Geithner,
from the Treasury Department.

778
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:42,281
Can you imagine that?

779
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:45,949
Now we have
the US Treasury Secretary,

780
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,428
who also is
a Robert Rubin protg

781
00:39:48,463 --> 00:39:53,093
of the Larry Summers group
that dismantled Glass-Steagall

782
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:55,701
and--and broke apart
the regulations

783
00:39:55,736 --> 00:39:58,873
that would have prohibited
the banks and brokerages

784
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,238
from becoming these criminals.

785
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:05,648
He was the former President
of the New York Federal Reserve?

786
00:40:05,683 --> 00:40:08,932
And now
he's our Treasury Secretary?

787
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:15,096
As we all know, the Federal Reserve
is as federal as Federal Express.

788
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,289
It's a private bank.

789
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,013
And now we've put
this guy in charge of it?

790
00:40:19,479 --> 00:40:20,270
I mean can't we...?

791
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,763
Wall Street has hijacked Washington
in broad daylight.

792
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,835
Every single one of his appointments
support the status quo.

793
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,714
Every one of his appointments
are there to screw the American people.

794
00:40:33,749 --> 00:40:37,580
Every single one of his appointments
are people who are working

795
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,287
to bring down the Republic
and the Constitution of this country.

796
00:40:42,011 --> 00:40:44,834
Secretary of the Treasury,
Timothy Geithner:

797
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,490
Bilderberg Group and
Trilateral Commission member.

798
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:53,100
Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton
is a Bilderberg and CFR member.

799
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:55,878
She is also married to
Trilateral Commission member,

800
00:40:55,913 --> 00:40:57,329
William Jefferson Clinton.

801
00:40:57,755 --> 00:41:01,008
Ambassador to the United Nations,
Susan Rice:

802
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:02,543
Trilateral Commission.

803
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:07,030
National Security Adviser,
General James L. Jones:

804
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,984
Bilderberg,
Trilateral Commission and CFR.

805
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:15,032
Deputy National Security Adviser,
Thomas Donilon:

806
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:17,178
Trilateral Commission, CFR.

807
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:22,418
Special State Department Envoy,
Henry Kissinger:

808
00:41:22,448 --> 00:41:26,153
Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission and CFR.

809
00:41:26,828 --> 00:41:29,923
Chairman, Economic Recovery Committee,
Paul Volcker:

810
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,132
Bilderberg Group,

811
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:34,245
Trilateral Commission,
Council on Foreign Relations.

812
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:39,083
The Director of National Intelligence,
Admiral Dennis C. Blair:

813
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,701
Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission, CFR.

814
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,681
Secretary of Defense,
Robert Gates:

815
00:41:46,793 --> 00:41:50,262
Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission, CFR.

816
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:54,324
Deputy Secretary of State,
James Steinberg:

817
00:41:54,591 --> 00:41:58,358
Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission, CFR.

818
00:41:59,636 --> 00:42:02,858
State Department Special Envoy,
Richard Haas:

819
00:42:02,893 --> 00:42:07,583
Bilderberg Group, Trilateral Commission,
and President of the CFR

820
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:11,464
Obama Presidential Adviser,
Alan Greenspan:

821
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:15,404
Bilderberg Group,
Trilateral Commission, CFR.

822
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:19,507
State Department Special Envoy,
Richard C. Holbrooke:

823
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,975
Bilderberg,
Trilateral, CFR.

824
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:25,963
And the list goes
on and on.

825
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:35,216
Even if Barack Obama were the most
wonderful person in the world,

826
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:37,425
he was groomed
and brought to power

827
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,182
by the global elite
to carry out <i>their</i> agenda.

828
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,054
Humanity must look
past Obama

829
00:42:44,072 --> 00:42:46,943
and realize that
presidents come and go,

830
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,371
but the Shadow Government

831
00:42:48,423 --> 00:42:52,359
and their program
of global enslavement continues.

832
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,368
How could people be
so stupid and gullible

833
00:42:56,708 --> 00:42:59,421
to believe
a bunch of political people.

834
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,828
So people
who voted for Obama

835
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:06,672
were trying to express I think, 
first of all, something worthwhile:

836
00:43:06,707 --> 00:43:09,530
their hatred for Bush,
Cheney, the neocons,

837
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:13,100
the desire to punish the Republicans
for their adventures,

838
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,329
their police state,
and their economic depression.

839
00:43:16,364 --> 00:43:18,888
The second question was,
on the economy,

840
00:43:18,918 --> 00:43:22,063
people felt that Bush was
selling them down the river

841
00:43:22,098 --> 00:43:23,227
into a world depression.

842
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:26,014
He is, of course, the new
Herbert Hoover in that regard,

843
00:43:26,049 --> 00:43:28,001
so they were trying to get
something different from that.

844
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:29,560
The tragedy,
of course, is

845
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,463
(and this is really why Obama
was groomed and prepared

846
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:34,694
over a period
of almost 30 years now)

847
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:40,114
that Obama is there to frustrate
and to deceive all of those hopes.

848
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,100
Obama is a cruel hoax.

849
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,400
He's a bogus sham.

850
00:43:43,735 --> 00:43:45,780
He's an absolute denial
of everything

851
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:48,153
that you'd expect from
an American president.

852
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,802
It is very disturbing
to see well-meaning people

853
00:43:50,852 --> 00:43:54,480
falling for high tech propaganda
over and over again.

854
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,756
It happened after 9/11.

855
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,148
The American people en masse
were swept into a mob psychology,

856
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,970
irrationally throwing
their common sense to the wind

857
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,826
and doing whatever
the administration told them to.

858
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,959
The general public eventually caught
on to the fact

859
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:15,816
that George W. Bush
was a deceitful thug

860
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:18,137
and that the economy
was in freefall.

861
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,173
In the midst of it all,
Barack Obama was there

862
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:23,503
speaking out against
the abuse of the people

863
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:25,132
at the hands
of the establishment.

864
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:28,700
With the election of Barack Obama,
the world rejoiced

865
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,410
that the United States was no longer
in the hands of mad men.

866
00:44:32,842 --> 00:44:37,158
But unfortunately for humanity,
this was another vicious fraud.

867
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,843
I want to like the guy.

868
00:44:38,878 --> 00:44:39,950
He speaks gently.

869
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:41,600
He's intelligent.

870
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:45,201
He is...
He seems to be a man of peace.

871
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,347
He is just as charismatic
as they come.

872
00:44:48,817 --> 00:44:50,053
But you know what:

873
00:44:50,121 --> 00:44:55,370
is that a tree is really, really
measured by the quality of its fruit.

874
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,465
And when you, kind of,
put away all the flowery words,

875
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,200
when you put away
all the rhetoric,

876
00:45:01,235 --> 00:45:03,901
when you put away
all the rock and roll music,

877
00:45:05,051 --> 00:45:09,079
what he does is what's important
for the people of this country,

878
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:10,794
starting with the truth.

879
00:45:11,177 --> 00:45:13,623
Obama is
notoriously a liar.

880
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:16,640
He promised that
he would get out of Iraq,

881
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,116
I think, within
16 months at some point.

882
00:45:19,151 --> 00:45:22,430
We had Samantha Power
telling <i>The Scotsman</i>

883
00:45:22,465 --> 00:45:24,745
that he wouldn't be bound
by those promises

884
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,095
and sure enough, he's now not
gonna be bound by those promises.

885
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,069
Obama pledged in hundreds
of speeches and interviews

886
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,130
that within six months
of being elected,

887
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,058
he was going to bring
our troops home from Iraq.

888
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:39,961
But after he was inaugurated,
the story changed.

889
00:45:39,996 --> 00:45:41,878
Now he said
that they would "look"

890
00:45:41,914 --> 00:45:45,750
at bringing "some" of the troops
home in 16 months.

891
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,701
Two weeks later,
his story had changed again.

892
00:45:48,736 --> 00:45:51,438
Now the administration
would "look"

893
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:53,900
at bringing the troops home
in 23 months.

894
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:55,955
Well,
Obama's already fudging.

895
00:45:56,261 --> 00:45:58,955
He has fudged since day one
in this election

896
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,738
to where he first said,
we're getting out.

897
00:46:00,773 --> 00:46:03,597
Well, now it's a timetable
and now it's da, da, da.

898
00:46:03,632 --> 00:46:04,919
'Cause they're getting
to him.

899
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:07,803
They're understanding
that he ain't gonna be able

900
00:46:07,838 --> 00:46:11,178
to get them out because
people more powerful than him got us in.

901
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,403
When he first ran, remember,
he was gonna take the troops out.

902
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:18,346
I get in there...
Troops come home, day one.

903
00:46:18,481 --> 00:46:21,697
There is no military solution in Iraq
and there never was.

904
00:46:22,201 --> 00:46:26,429
I will begin to remove our troops
from Iraq immediately.

905
00:46:26,856 --> 00:46:28,954
And then that went to
16 months.

906
00:46:30,023 --> 00:46:31,543
And now he's going to add,
they're saying,

907
00:46:31,578 --> 00:46:35,232
another 30,000,
or more troops to Afghanistan.

908
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,148
Next, he sent 30,000
more Marines to Afghanistan,

909
00:46:40,183 --> 00:46:43,178
doubling the total number of forces
in the crosshairs.

910
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,801
Barack then announced
that he was going to move

911
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:51,100
missile systems into Eastern Europe
to encircle Russia.

912
00:46:51,325 --> 00:46:53,629
But after all,
what should we expect,

913
00:46:53,822 --> 00:46:57,362
after he kept Bush's
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates?

914
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,432
The outcome
of this policy is

915
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:02,138
if you're constantly meddling
near the Russian borders

916
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,379
with these fascist creeps,

917
00:47:04,426 --> 00:47:07,493
IMF-NATO agents like
Yushchenko of Ukraine,

918
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:11,935
or Sakashvilli of Georgia,
or these Kachinsky twins in Poland,

919
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,220
or various collections of people
in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,

920
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:20,744
you're tied to these gangsters
and if they decide to start a war,

921
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:23,952
that rapidly escalates
into thermonuclear World War III.

922
00:47:23,987 --> 00:47:25,866
This is worse
than the neocons.

923
00:47:25,901 --> 00:47:28,252
Bush and Cheney
never got as far

924
00:47:28,368 --> 00:47:31,898
as Brzezinski, Soros and
the other people running Obama.

925
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,296
Barack Obama swore that he would
vote to repeal the Patriot Act,

926
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:40,212
but then he voted
for it's reauthorization.

927
00:47:40,412 --> 00:47:43,417
Obama decried
the Bush administration's

928
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:46,545
illegal warrantless wiretapping
of the American people.

929
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,680
Then he voted
to legalize it.

930
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,016
Obama pledged
that he would filibuster

931
00:47:54,051 --> 00:47:56,621
any attempt
to give retroactive immunity

932
00:47:56,656 --> 00:47:59,671
to the telephone companies,
the telecom companies.

933
00:47:59,706 --> 00:48:04,011
Except, he then turned around
and voted <i>for</i> that bill.

934
00:48:04,046 --> 00:48:05,969
Most people don't know,
for example,

935
00:48:06,004 --> 00:48:08,731
that he voted
to reinstate the Patriot Act

936
00:48:08,749 --> 00:48:10,555
and more
government wiretapping.

937
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:13,794
Candidate Obama told
desperate factory workers

938
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:15,396
in speech after speech

939
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:17,910
that he was going
to renegotiate NAFTA and GATT

940
00:48:17,911 --> 00:48:20,138
to make it more fair
for American workers.

941
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:24,170
It is absolutely true
that NAFTA was a mistake.

942
00:48:24,698 --> 00:48:27,745
But then his campaign was caught
sending out memos

943
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,130
to top corporate leaders,

944
00:48:29,165 --> 00:48:32,746
telling them not to worry
and that it was just campaign rhetoric.

945
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:34,985
We had Obama saying,
"You know, I'm against free trade."

946
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,404
"I don't like NAFTA
and all those free trade sellouts."

947
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,850
We had Austin Goldsby
going to the Canadian diplomats

948
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,263
and saying,
"Don't, don't mind him.

949
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,716
He's just popping off.
That's just election era rhetoric.

950
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:46,936
It doesn't mean anything."

951
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:50,523
Presidential candidate Barack Obama
was publicly criticizing

952
00:48:50,558 --> 00:48:53,373
the North American Free Trade Agreement
in a bid for votes,

953
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:56,874
but privately telling Canadian officials
not to worry about it.

954
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,676
He said that he was going
to bring us peace in the Middle East.

955
00:49:00,711 --> 00:49:02,465
He said that
he was going to bring us

956
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:06,254
transparency
and a balanced economy.

957
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:11,035
He said that he was going
to not have, have lobbyists.

958
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:13,829
He said he was going
to clean up government.

959
00:49:13,864 --> 00:49:16,785
He said he was going
to work for the environment.

960
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,074
And point, by point,
by point,

961
00:49:20,116 --> 00:49:24,407
within the first month
of his inauguration,

962
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:32,972
he has lied, and deceived,
and cheated the American people.

963
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,190
The people of the United States
and the world were filled with hope

964
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:40,613
that Obama was the real deal,
when in his first week in office,

965
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:42,161
he signed
an executive order

966
00:49:42,186 --> 00:49:45,907
supposedly closing Guantanamo Bay
and other secret prisons.

967
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,488
Then the press actually had a chance
to read the executive order

968
00:49:49,523 --> 00:49:53,633
and were shocked to find
that the executive order only said

969
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:57,370
that Obama was thinking about
closing Guantanamo in a year.

970
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,750
But worst of all,

971
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:02,424
the executive order continued
the practice of rendition,

972
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:06,136
which the LA Times called,
<i>secret abductions</i>.

973
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:07,776
They don't know.

974
00:50:07,868 --> 00:50:11,656
They think that he signed off
immediately on closing Guantanamo,

975
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,822
but he's allowing prisoners now
to be taken to foreign countries,

976
00:50:15,857 --> 00:50:18,557
and not knowing where
they're sending them,

977
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,343
and to be tortured
in foreign countries.

978
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,936
They don't know that
they kept that provision in there.

979
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:30,875
Obama is now continuing the practice
of secret arrest, secret prisons,

980
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,950
and most importantly,
indefinite detention without trial.

981
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,555
When a British high court
said that

982
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:42,433
it was preparing to release secret
British and US torture orders

983
00:50:42,468 --> 00:50:46,178
that prove that the Bush administration
was ordering personnel

984
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,929
to systematically abuse
detainees,

985
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:53,362
Barack Obama threatened to cut
of all US intelligence ties to England.

986
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,869
To add
insult to injury,

987
00:50:54,941 --> 00:50:58,485
he stated that the program
was important to national security,

988
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,163
not only endorsing Bush's crimes,
but continuing them.

989
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,825
Obama voted for reinstatement
of the Patriot Act

990
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,461
and by his early deeds already again,
as we saw with his...

991
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,704
the issues of retention,
he's willing to send people

992
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,900
that have been charged
with nothing

993
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,468
to be tortured to, so-called,
get the truth out of them.

994
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:24,565
If the makers of this film attempted
to cover all of Obama's lies,

995
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,985
this documentary
would never be released

996
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,974
because there are new ones
every day.

997
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,846
So, in the interest of time,
we're going to cover one more big one.

998
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:37,944
Barack and his handlers
made the cornerstone of his campaign,

999
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:41,119
keeping lobbyists and donors
out of his administration.

1000
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:45,161
Within hours of being elected,
Obama did a 180

1001
00:51:45,196 --> 00:51:47,777
and filled the White House
and Federal Government

1002
00:51:47,812 --> 00:51:50,907
with lobbyists and donors
at all levels.

1003
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:56,460
Obama picked William Lynn,
the top lobbyist for Raytheon,

1004
00:51:56,495 --> 00:51:59,255
to fill the number two position
of the Department of Defense.

1005
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,948
Timothy Geithner,

1006
00:52:02,973 --> 00:52:06,289
former president of the private
Federal Reserve Bank of New York,

1007
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,518
was picked by Obama
to be Secretary of the Treasury.

1008
00:52:09,978 --> 00:52:12,147
Geithner promptly crammed
the Treasury Department

1009
00:52:12,182 --> 00:52:15,957
full of lobbyists like his
Chief of Staff, Mark Patterson,

1010
00:52:15,992 --> 00:52:19,019
formerly the top lobbyist
at Goldman Sachs.

1011
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:23,158
Obama appointed top lobbyist
to the Saudi Royal Family,

1012
00:52:23,193 --> 00:52:24,440
George Mitchell,

1013
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,700
as the lead
Middle Eastern envoy.

1014
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:30,218
Obama appointed the king
of Wall Street lobbyists,

1015
00:52:30,253 --> 00:52:32,905
Leon Panetta,
to head up the CIA.

1016
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:39,299
Obama tapped Tom Daschle,
top lobbyist for healthcare firms,

1017
00:52:39,334 --> 00:52:41,845
to run the Department of Health
and Human Services.

1018
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,595
And the list goes
on and on.

1019
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:47,570
Then, three weeks
into his administration,

1020
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:51,338
Obama launched a new lie,
more outrageous than the previous.

1021
00:52:51,373 --> 00:52:56,119
With Academy Award-level conviction,
he said that he was upset

1022
00:52:56,154 --> 00:53:00,704
about the banker bailout which
his own Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel,

1023
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:04,345
another former Wall Street executive,
had engineered.

1024
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:09,490
Obama said that he had signed
an executive order

1025
00:53:09,525 --> 00:53:14,207
capping the CEO salaries of those
who had taken the bailout money.

1026
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,144
There was just
two problems:

1027
00:53:16,195 --> 00:53:19,946
All the major banks and
brokerage firms were exempt,

1028
00:53:19,981 --> 00:53:24,400
and the new order only dealt
with any future bailouts,

1029
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:27,232
and those were to be
on the honor system.

1030
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,223
What gets people upset,
and rightfully so,

1031
00:53:31,614 --> 00:53:34,155
are executives
being rewarded for failure.

1032
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,695
AIG, Bank of America, and CitiGroup,
which have received billions

1033
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,328
in bailout money
don't fall under this plan.

1034
00:53:41,363 --> 00:53:45,565
Only banks negotiating future agreements
with the government will be restricted.

1035
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,135
But this appears to be built
on an honor system,

1036
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:50,347
and White House Press Secretary,
Robert Gibbs,

1037
00:53:50,382 --> 00:53:53,490
had a hard time explaining
how enforcement would work.

1038
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,199
Well, let, let,
let me get...

1039
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,190
I--I will get clarification
from Treasury on that.

1040
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:02,384
Generally speaking,
this is already the biggest liar

1041
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:05,290
and the biggest disappointment
that we've seen in recent history.

1042
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:09,750
And again, qualitatively
beyond the rather low standard set

1043
00:54:09,785 --> 00:54:14,409
by Bush the Elder and Clinton,
in terms of delivering on promises.

1044
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:15,580
Bottom line:

1045
00:54:15,636 --> 00:54:20,272
Obama is a fantastic actor
and an even better liar.

1046
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,201
His track record
is clear.

1047
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,906
He has done the opposite of everything
he told the people he would do.

1048
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,771
They'll make up
one lie after another.

1049
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,429
And if you believe these people,
knock yourself out.

1050
00:54:35,464 --> 00:54:37,819
I don't believe
a word they say.

1051
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,571
Within one month of the passage
of the first banker bailout bill,

1052
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:45,896
the press reported that
over five trillion dollars

1053
00:54:45,931 --> 00:54:48,719
had just disappeared
out of the US Treasury.

1054
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,571
By December, the amount of money
that had been stolen

1055
00:54:52,606 --> 00:54:54,531
had reached
$8.5 trillion.

1056
00:54:54,566 --> 00:54:56,882
The leadership
of both political parties

1057
00:54:56,912 --> 00:54:59,772
circled the wagons
and would not discuss

1058
00:54:59,807 --> 00:55:01,013
where the money
had gone.

1059
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:06,134
End the Fed! End the Fed!
End the Fed! End the Fed!

1060
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:09,962
Informed Americans protested
the private Federal Reserve System

1061
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:13,504
at all 38 of their regional
governorship offices.

1062
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,571
Arrest
Bernanke and Paulson!

1063
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:21,012
Arrest all the criminals
that stole the banker bailout money!

1064
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:23,024
Yeah! Yeah!

1065
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:26,074
It was refreshing
to see people standing up

1066
00:55:26,109 --> 00:55:27,891
against
the real power structure,

1067
00:55:27,926 --> 00:55:30,901
not being distracted
by the elite's front men like

1068
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:33,364
George W. Bush
and Barack Obama.

1069
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:37,022
We traveled
to Dallas, Texas,

1070
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:40,845
to cover "We, the people,"
taking on the real enemy.

1071
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,748
Hey, I want to talk to the workers
up there on the parapet,

1072
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,215
the ones smoking cigarettes
that just jumped back.

1073
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,697
You--You're with the American people,
we know that.

1074
00:55:51,732 --> 00:55:54,203
But understand,
ask the workers inside,

1075
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,843
you're not in
a Federal Government building.

1076
00:55:56,878 --> 00:56:01,767
You're in a private Federal Reserve
that uses that name as a fraud.

1077
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,238
That'd be like if my first name was
Federal Reserve Jones.

1078
00:56:05,273 --> 00:56:07,275
I'm still not
the Federal Government.

1079
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,847
I'm not a federal agency.

1080
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:11,215
But, if I said my name was
Federal Reserve,

1081
00:56:11,693 --> 00:56:13,760
I could go out
and pay off politicians

1082
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,063
and get them to allow me
to get into power

1083
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:18,770
so I could issue
the currency and credit

1084
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:20,555
and then
I could buy up the world.

1085
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:22,610
That's what
these criminals have done.

1086
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,451
A lot of people think
that the Federal Reserve

1087
00:56:24,486 --> 00:56:25,445
is already
part of the government.

1088
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,090
They're not.

1089
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:29,895
It's controlled by cliques of
unelected, unaccountable bankers

1090
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,032
meeting in secret.

1091
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,900
Most of these people
have never even been through

1092
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,056
the formality of a Senate hearing
or a Senate confirmation.

1093
00:56:36,282 --> 00:56:38,745
They claim that they're part of
the US government.

1094
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,920
They masquerade as if they were part
of the US government.

1095
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:45,086
But in reality,
this is a purely private operation.

1096
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:48,005
Jackals, hyenas, raptors,
all of them loyal,

1097
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,230
not to the American people,

1098
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:52,021
but to the Wall Street banks,
which is where most of them come from.

1099
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,295
Everyone is pointing
to Barack right now,

1100
00:56:54,296 --> 00:56:56,490
President Obama,
and saying,

1101
00:56:56,490 --> 00:57:00,140
"Ya gotta get the economy together,
ya gotta get the economy together,"

1102
00:57:00,234 --> 00:57:01,642
when in fact,
the President

1103
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:04,373
has very little
to do with the economy.

1104
00:57:04,408 --> 00:57:10,353
It's the Federal Reserve Chairman
that at least sets the policy.

1105
00:57:10,388 --> 00:57:14,676
That's a privately owned company,
the Federal Reserve Bank.

1106
00:57:14,939 --> 00:57:16,816
They set the agenda.

1107
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,614
These guys are masquerading
as a federal institution.

1108
00:57:20,649 --> 00:57:22,846
They are a
private banking consortium

1109
00:57:22,881 --> 00:57:24,934
and this is their front,
their holding company.

1110
00:57:24,969 --> 00:57:26,411
The Federal Reserve
is not federal.

1111
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:28,652
It's a front
for a private banking cartel.

1112
00:57:28,687 --> 00:57:30,406
That's on record
(congressional testimony),

1113
00:57:30,441 --> 00:57:31,706
and they're the ones
orchestrating

1114
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:33,375
the economic collapse
we're seeing right now.

1115
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,190
So that's why
we're here.

1116
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,667
While at the <i>End the Fed</i> rally
outside the Federal Reserve Bank

1117
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:41,223
in Dallas, Texas, we spoke with
Ron Paul's brother, Wayne Paul.

1118
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:47,067
1913:
The Federal Reserve Act was passed.

1119
00:57:47,492 --> 00:57:52,018
Floor of the House, where three members
of Congress were on the floor.

1120
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,911
At that time, they only needed
a majority of votes to pass it.

1121
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:01,132
So in 1913,
the Federal Reserve Act was passed.

1122
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:06,276
20 years later, in 1933,
under Roosevelt,

1123
00:58:06,598 --> 00:58:09,837
the United States
was declared bankrupt.

1124
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,290
And in 1933,
the Federal Reserve private bank says,

1125
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:19,539
"Okay, USA, what are
you gonna pledge as collateral

1126
00:58:19,574 --> 00:58:21,445
on the debt
you owe me?"

1127
00:58:22,371 --> 00:58:24,561
What happened by 1936?

1128
00:58:24,596 --> 00:58:26,578
- Does anybody know?
- They had us...

1129
00:58:26,613 --> 00:58:32,995
We instituted Social Security system,
and you and I, and our children,

1130
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:36,145
and our children's children
were pledged as collateral

1131
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,206
on the debt of our government
to the Federal Reserve.

1132
00:58:40,236 --> 00:58:41,956
And that's
where we're at today.

1133
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:45,286
It took 20 years
to make this country bankrupt

1134
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:46,327
and since then,

1135
00:58:46,585 --> 00:58:50,537
our government
has operated under

1136
00:58:50,538 --> 00:58:53,705
emergency powers
of our government.

1137
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:59,022
It is not the President
that makes the decision in this country.

1138
00:58:59,948 --> 00:59:03,998
It's the Secretary of Treasury
who turns around

1139
00:59:04,394 --> 00:59:07,552
and is put in there
by the Federal Reserve

1140
00:59:07,553 --> 00:59:10,061
to manage the bankruptcy.

1141
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:13,133
We've been in bankruptcy
ever since.

1142
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,499
So, to print 700 billion dollars
and to give it away,

1143
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:18,278
how do they get
away with it?

1144
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:22,175
The manager of the bankruptcy
is told by the Federal Reserve,

1145
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,363
"This is the way to go."

1146
00:59:24,002 --> 00:59:25,513
That's where
we're at today.

1147
00:59:26,028 --> 00:59:27,583
Yes,
we should point out,

1148
00:59:27,681 --> 00:59:31,525
Congressman Ron Paul now has
a huge amount of sponsors

1149
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:34,789
for a bill in
the House of Representatives

1150
00:59:34,824 --> 00:59:38,722
to abolish the private Federal Reserve
crime syndicate.

1151
00:59:40,471 --> 00:59:46,205
In 1913, the money power of the country
was taken away from the people.

1152
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:51,297
By Constitutional privilege,
it belongs with the Congress,

1153
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,445
but it was given up
in the Federal Reserve Act.

1154
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,166
The Federal Reserve is no more "federal"
than Federal Express.

1155
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,368
But yet,
it has the power

1156
01:00:01,403 --> 01:00:04,240
to determine the direction
of use of money in our economy.

1157
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,226
If we could
take that power back

1158
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:09,280
and put the Federal Reserve
under Treasury,

1159
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,723
we start to be
in a position

1160
01:00:12,564 --> 01:00:16,285
of being able
to control monetary policy

1161
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,342
on behalf of
the United States people.

1162
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:21,235
The Federal Reserve
is totally private

1163
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,654
and Alan Greenspan,
two weeks ago on PBS,

1164
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:25,662
on <i>Lehrer News Hour</i>,
said,

1165
01:00:25,697 --> 01:00:28,834
on record that
they are above the law,

1166
01:00:28,869 --> 01:00:31,249
the Congress,
the President, everyone.

1167
01:00:31,284 --> 01:00:33,404
No court can do anything.

1168
01:00:33,439 --> 01:00:34,710
"We run America."

1169
01:00:35,654 --> 01:00:38,701
What is the, uh,
proper relationship?

1170
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:40,639
What should be
the proper relationship

1171
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:43,934
between a chairman of the Fed
and a President of the United States?

1172
01:00:45,069 --> 01:00:47,435
Well, first of all,
the Federal Reserve

1173
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,303
is an independent agency
and that means, basically,

1174
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:55,763
that there is
no other agency of government

1175
01:00:55,798 --> 01:00:59,219
which can overrule actions
that we take.

1176
01:01:00,248 --> 01:01:03,451
So long as
that is in place,

1177
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:07,422
and there is no evidence
that the administration

1178
01:01:07,457 --> 01:01:09,978
or the Congress
or anybody else

1179
01:01:09,979 --> 01:01:11,799
is requesting
that we do things

1180
01:01:11,861 --> 01:01:13,987
other than what we think
is the appropriate thing,

1181
01:01:14,332 --> 01:01:18,869
then what the relationships are
don't frankly matter.

1182
01:01:18,904 --> 01:01:20,396
Notice what Greenspan is saying.

1183
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:23,728
Greenspan is saying
the Federal Reserve is beyond the law.

1184
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,294
And in reality, they are,
in practice, beyond the law.

1185
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:29,957
Nobody, as far as I know,
has ever audited the Federal Reserve.

1186
01:01:29,992 --> 01:01:31,670
One of the first things
we ought to do

1187
01:01:31,705 --> 01:01:33,339
when we nationalize
the Fed,

1188
01:01:33,374 --> 01:01:35,842
is go in there
and find out the audit.

1189
01:01:35,877 --> 01:01:39,067
Who stole money?
Who engaged in corruption?

1190
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,120
There's a whole
series of people going back

1191
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:45,829
to Volker, to Greenspan,
to Bernanke, uh, and so forth.

1192
01:01:45,864 --> 01:01:47,531
Think of the arrogance!

1193
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:51,005
A private group of banks
that have bankrupted the nation

1194
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,049
by design,
so they can repo the country.

1195
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:57,819
A private group of banks
that loaned us our own money back

1196
01:01:57,854 --> 01:02:00,553
are telling us
they're above the law.

1197
01:02:01,157 --> 01:02:03,570
You are not above the law,
criminals!

1198
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:05,241
No one
is above the law!

1199
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,028
No one
is above the law,

1200
01:02:07,063 --> 01:02:10,444
and the private Federal Reserve
sure as hell ain't either.

1201
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,803
Since the founding
of the Federal Reserve

1202
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:15,261
back under
Woodrow Wilson,

1203
01:02:15,913 --> 01:02:18,614
the Federal Reserve
has struck out three times.

1204
01:02:18,649 --> 01:02:20,660
They didn't stop
the crash of 1929,

1205
01:02:20,792 --> 01:02:24,318
they didn't stop
the banking panic of 1930-1933,

1206
01:02:24,353 --> 01:02:26,380
and now
they are the cause

1207
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,375
of the derivatives crisis
because they're the ones

1208
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:31,704
who inflicted derivatives
on the world with Alan Greenspan.

1209
01:02:31,739 --> 01:02:33,754
Instead of our economy
being about

1210
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,715
goods and services and
real products and manufacturing,

1211
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,640
it's all about
these guys,

1212
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,531
the private Federal Reserve
that masquerades

1213
01:02:40,566 --> 01:02:41,546
as a government entity,

1214
01:02:41,956 --> 01:02:44,920
who controls the issuance
of currency and credit.

1215
01:02:44,955 --> 01:02:48,125
They're the ones that have cut off
the liquidity in the market.

1216
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,748
They told us to have
a debt-based economy,

1217
01:02:49,879 --> 01:02:52,465
then they cut it off,
once they get us under their thumb

1218
01:02:52,657 --> 01:02:55,522
and implode the economy
so they can consolidate it.

1219
01:02:55,557 --> 01:02:56,576
That's what
they're doing right now.

1220
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:58,973
I mean, it--it's in their own documents.
It's in their own statements.

1221
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,286
They claim,
"Give us unlimited power.

1222
01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:03,548
Give us trillions of dollars of the
banker bailout bill."

1223
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:06,913
That's already five trillion dollars,
not $850 billion as they say.

1224
01:03:07,245 --> 01:03:09,144
And, and,
"We'll get the economy going."

1225
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:11,467
But they're hoarding the money
and buying up other banks

1226
01:03:11,468 --> 01:03:12,700
that aren't part
of the Federal Reserve,

1227
01:03:12,735 --> 01:03:15,112
buying up insurance companies,
buying up roads,

1228
01:03:15,147 --> 01:03:17,987
infrastructures, media empires,
defense contractors.

1229
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,429
What the banks do is
they implode an economy

1230
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,660
by cutting off, uh,
credit

1231
01:03:22,695 --> 01:03:24,959
and then once
things really fall to a low,

1232
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:27,594
and they know the low
because then they buy everything up,

1233
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:30,664
and start then putting more money
back into the economy,

1234
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:31,740
and then
they build it back up.

1235
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,570
So they build us up and then shear us,
build us up and shear us,

1236
01:03:34,605 --> 01:03:35,739
and they're getting ready...

1237
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,900
All over the world they're always
shearing some country, imploding it.

1238
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:41,051
Comes out in their own
IMF and World Bank documents.

1239
01:03:41,086 --> 01:03:43,146
That's just the foreign arm
of the same cartel.

1240
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,771
And these are the people who claim to be
the saviors of the economy,

1241
01:03:46,806 --> 01:03:49,296
the people who have created
every important crisis

1242
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,899
in the past hundred years,
the Federal Reserve.

1243
01:03:51,934 --> 01:03:55,806
So, it's illegal, it's unconstitutional,
and it's a failure.

1244
01:03:55,841 --> 01:03:58,646
And I think the failure is what
everybody can see right now.

1245
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:00,930
Yeah, what they do is,
they make you think

1246
01:04:00,965 --> 01:04:02,340
Clinton's evil
in running things.

1247
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:04,990
Then, oh, Bush'll save us,
and then, oh, Bush was evil.

1248
01:04:05,527 --> 01:04:07,900
Now, we'll be saved by
Barack Obama.

1249
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:08,845
But he's just a puppet.

1250
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,679
But as we get deeper
into this phase,

1251
01:04:11,903 --> 01:04:13,424
when they implode
the economy,

1252
01:04:13,459 --> 01:04:15,242
they have all the money
and all the control,

1253
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:17,580
and then... but they also like
to pose as the savior.

1254
01:04:17,769 --> 01:04:21,140
So, Obama is meant to be
the savior during the depression

1255
01:04:21,175 --> 01:04:23,900
and he'll save us
with a million person

1256
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:25,087
(he said
as big or bigger

1257
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:27,137
than our military)
domestic spy force,

1258
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,300
a three million person
environmental spy force.

1259
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:34,331
So giving people these jobs
to be government bureaucrats and spies

1260
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:36,406
to go out
and manage, uh, the other,

1261
01:04:36,448 --> 01:04:39,318
 you know,
290 something million Americans.

1262
01:04:39,353 --> 01:04:43,500
And so this is classical fascism.
The Communists also do it.

1263
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,131
Any vertically-integrated,
command-and-control

1264
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:48,370
authoritarian system
does this.

1265
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:50,162
So, they're openly following

1266
01:04:50,202 --> 01:04:53,200
what the same group of banks
did in Germany, Russia.

1267
01:04:53,235 --> 01:04:54,584
You know, it's in
the Communist Manifesto

1268
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:56,692
to have
a private central bank,

1269
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:59,730
because the private central bankers
actually wrote the ideas

1270
01:04:59,765 --> 01:05:01,170
that they had
Marx and Engels put out.

1271
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,958
People go, "Well, why would
the banks want communism?"

1272
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:04,206
It doesn't exist.

1273
01:05:04,464 --> 01:05:06,541
They rape us.
They consolidate us.

1274
01:05:06,576 --> 01:05:08,912
They put us into work brigades.
They make us slaves.

1275
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,621
And they say,
"It's a people's paradise!

1276
01:05:10,963 --> 01:05:13,051
Look at it!
Boy, you're really doing good!"

1277
01:05:13,086 --> 01:05:16,393
And then, they transfer all
the wealth of the nation offshore.

1278
01:05:16,428 --> 01:05:17,945
The globalists
are outside all the nations.

1279
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,023
That gives them safety,

1280
01:05:19,064 --> 01:05:20,987
and they play countries off
against each other.

1281
01:05:21,022 --> 01:05:22,900
And so that's what
we're facing and dealing with.

1282
01:05:22,935 --> 01:05:26,266
And so they're bringing in
classical hardcore tyranny into the US.

1283
01:05:26,587 --> 01:05:27,699
But we have
the Internet.

1284
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,135
We've grown our numbers.

1285
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:30,435
The alternative media's
exploded.

1286
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,516
That's why
they're trying to move in

1287
01:05:31,546 --> 01:05:33,528
to shut down and regulate
and tax the web.

1288
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:34,710
But it's
too late for them.

1289
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:39,065
They're, they're playing
in the 19th century, 20th century rules.

1290
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,405
It's the 21st century,

1291
01:05:40,746 --> 01:05:43,237
this, the century of resistance
to tyranny.

1292
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:44,954
And so it's gonna be
one hell of a fight,

1293
01:05:45,259 --> 01:05:47,486
with the people and
free humanity on one side

1294
01:05:47,521 --> 01:05:48,766
and the New World Order
on the other.

1295
01:05:48,801 --> 01:05:51,992
And every one of you out there counts,
needs to be involved in this fight

1296
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:53,952
like nothing you've been
involved with before,

1297
01:05:53,982 --> 01:05:55,214
because this is
life and death.

1298
01:05:55,249 --> 01:05:57,829
Everything depends on
exposing these people.

1299
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:01,597
Everything depends on showing the people
that this is the New World Order,

1300
01:06:01,632 --> 01:06:02,652
this is
the criminals.

1301
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:04,710
We're dealing
with the king rats here,

1302
01:06:04,745 --> 01:06:07,090
the people that are carrying out
tyranny worldwide.

1303
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:09,154
And, either they fall
or we fall.

1304
01:06:09,253 --> 01:06:10,610
Either worldwide darkness

1305
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:14,925
and a new age of tyranny and oppression
with a scientific overlay,

1306
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,290
or a new age of liberty and freedom
and a new renaissance.

1307
01:06:18,325 --> 01:06:20,990
The choice, the choice
is the people's out there.

1308
01:06:21,025 --> 01:06:22,580
Okay, we can tell you
what's going on.

1309
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:24,247
You can check out for yourself
and find out it's true.

1310
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,157
But don't wait.

1311
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:27,210
Investigate now.
Get involved now.

1312
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:28,599
Go out there
and reach out now.

1313
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:29,639
We don't have time.

1314
01:06:29,674 --> 01:06:32,989
If you're looking for the solution,
look in the mirror.

1315
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,320
Look right into the mirror
because you out there

1316
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:37,425
men, women, old,
young, black, white,

1317
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,139
it doesn't matter.

1318
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:41,094
It's going to be up to <i>you</i>
if they win

1319
01:06:41,215 --> 01:06:42,914
or if liberty succeeds

1320
01:06:42,954 --> 01:06:45,166
and the people have a chance
of having any future.

1321
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,845
These are
cold-blooded eugenicists.

1322
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:49,031
These are cold-blooded people
who think they're God,

1323
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:51,245
think that they're our masters,
that think that we're animals.

1324
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,900
These are the guys that funded
Lenin and Stalin, and Hitler and Mao.

1325
01:06:54,935 --> 01:06:57,750
These are the guys (it's all on record)
that bankroll this stuff.

1326
01:06:57,785 --> 01:07:01,221
They are hardcore vicious,
and they must be resisted.

1327
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,216
Up until about
the Kennedy assassination

1328
01:07:04,276 --> 01:07:06,146
and the beginning of the war
in Vietnam,

1329
01:07:06,181 --> 01:07:08,584
the United States is
a very powerful engine

1330
01:07:08,619 --> 01:07:09,599
for world progress.

1331
01:07:09,634 --> 01:07:12,175
It's the assassinations,
the Kennedy assassination

1332
01:07:12,225 --> 01:07:14,110
and the others
in the 1960s,

1333
01:07:14,110 --> 01:07:15,821
the beginning
of the Vietnam war,

1334
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,400
and the beginning
of the absolute domination

1335
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,659
of the Wall Street group
over every other interest.

1336
01:07:20,694 --> 01:07:24,024
Nobody else counts except
the Wall Street money masters.

1337
01:07:24,059 --> 01:07:26,408
That has now made
the United States into,

1338
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,713
no longer
a force for progress,

1339
01:07:28,748 --> 01:07:29,821
but something very different;

1340
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:31,713
often a force for destruction
in the world.

1341
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,811
That doesn't need
to remain that way.

1342
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,006
The interest of the American people
is to fight the...

1343
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:38,030
Take your government
back from Wall Street,

1344
01:07:38,059 --> 01:07:41,651
and make the United States
a force for progress in the world,

1345
01:07:41,686 --> 01:07:43,034
which we easily could do

1346
01:07:43,055 --> 01:07:46,105
if we could just break the power
of the people behind Obama.

1347
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,600
The main banks
of Europe,

1348
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:50,790
which were started by Adam Weishaupt
and, and Rothschild,

1349
01:07:50,790 --> 01:07:55,141
the Banque Nationale de Paris,
The Bank of England, The Bank of Italy,

1350
01:07:55,176 --> 01:07:57,907
have all financed
the messianic

1351
01:07:58,347 --> 01:08:01,529
and, and war leaders
of the last 200 years.

1352
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:06,806
Napoleon.
Lenin. Stalin.

1353
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:10,307
They backed Adolf Hitler.

1354
01:08:10,342 --> 01:08:13,141
They backed
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

1355
01:08:13,176 --> 01:08:15,774
And they are backing,
right now,

1356
01:08:16,398 --> 01:08:18,068
Barack Obama.

1357
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:22,333
The banking cartel had established
a beachhead in 1913

1358
01:08:22,368 --> 01:08:23,860
through
the Federal Reserve Act.

1359
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:27,052
In 1947, they set up
a parallel Shadow Government

1360
01:08:27,087 --> 01:08:28,923
through
the National Security Act.

1361
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,567
From '47 on,
the National Security State

1362
01:08:35,602 --> 01:08:36,999
began the long process

1363
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:40,012
of absorbing
federal and state bureaucracies,

1364
01:08:40,047 --> 01:08:41,248
while at
the same time,

1365
01:08:41,277 --> 01:08:43,941
undermining
the constitutional power of Congress

1366
01:08:43,976 --> 01:08:45,937
and dominating
the Executive Branch.

1367
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:51,470
By controlling the issuance
of currency and credit,

1368
01:08:51,505 --> 01:08:55,557
the private Federal Reserve was able
to buy up most of the Fortune 500.

1369
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,850
And if a company wouldn't sell,
the bankers would unleash

1370
01:09:00,885 --> 01:09:03,301
federal regulators
to run them out of business.

1371
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:08,149
Private central banks in Europe,
the United States and England

1372
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,813
took taxpayer money and loaned it
at over 30% interest

1373
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:13,646
to third world nations.

1374
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:17,904
The bankers would then bribe
the leaders of those countries

1375
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:19,848
not to pay back
the loans.

1376
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:22,708
Their third world puppets
would sign agreements

1377
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:25,298
stating that
when the country defaulted,

1378
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:28,868
the banks would be given all
the natural resources and infrastructure

1379
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:30,787
of the once sovereign lands.

1380
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,234
But worst of all,

1381
01:09:32,515 --> 01:09:35,124
the countries would pledge
future taxes,

1382
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:39,865
paid by the people, in perpetuity,
as profit to the private banks.

1383
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:45,940
By the year 2000,
there were few nations

1384
01:09:46,068 --> 01:09:49,331
that had not fallen to the designs
of the money power.

1385
01:09:49,665 --> 01:09:51,933
The globalists were now
ready to start

1386
01:09:51,968 --> 01:09:54,974
their final phase
of world government takeover,

1387
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,340
the destruction
of the Western nation's economies.

1388
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,621
To carry out
their final takeover,

1389
01:10:02,752 --> 01:10:05,253
they first removed
banking regulations,

1390
01:10:05,288 --> 01:10:08,554
like the Glass-Steagall Act,
in the late 1990s.

1391
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:12,892
This allowed
their front companies

1392
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:15,727
to issue unlimited credit
to the world

1393
01:10:15,777 --> 01:10:18,544
and to set up
colossal Ponzi schemes,

1394
01:10:18,573 --> 01:10:21,256
the likes of which
the world had never seen.

1395
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:26,053
The scams were advertised
by the controlled corporate media

1396
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,927
as completely legitimate.

1397
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,632
Because of
the fantastic returns,

1398
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:33,923
private investors,
corporations,

1399
01:10:33,969 --> 01:10:36,354
state and local governments,
invested heavily.

1400
01:10:36,389 --> 01:10:39,578
They had taken the bait:
hook, line and sinker.

1401
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:42,658
To destroy confidence,

1402
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:45,709
in late 2007,
the bankers themselves

1403
01:10:45,744 --> 01:10:48,741
began to badmouth
the scams <i>they</i> had created.

1404
01:10:50,693 --> 01:10:54,001
Next, the central bankers cut off
the tsunami of fiat money

1405
01:10:54,036 --> 01:10:56,156
that they had been using
to pump up the bubble.

1406
01:10:56,382 --> 01:10:58,153
When Congress
and the public

1407
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:01,436
refused to write the finance oligarchs
a blank check,

1408
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:05,189
the bankers began to engage
in financial terrorism.

1409
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,638
They said that the world would go
into another great depression

1410
01:11:09,673 --> 01:11:13,481
unless their demands were met,
further destroying confidence.

1411
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:18,088
The stock market instantly had
its biggest one day loss in history.

1412
01:11:18,123 --> 01:11:21,042
But even that wasn't enough
to force Congress

1413
01:11:21,077 --> 01:11:23,717
to capitulate
to the offshore banks.

1414
01:11:24,710 --> 01:11:26,927
Senator Inhofe
of Oklahoma,

1415
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:29,709
and Congressman
Brad Sherman of California,

1416
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,775
amongst others,
told the world

1417
01:11:31,836 --> 01:11:34,736
that the entire Congress
had been threatened

1418
01:11:34,771 --> 01:11:37,997
with martial law by the White House
and the Treasury Department

1419
01:11:38,032 --> 01:11:40,972
if they didn't pass the so-called
banker bailout bill.

1420
01:11:41,007 --> 01:11:43,253
The only way
they can pass this bill

1421
01:11:43,565 --> 01:11:47,200
is by creating and sustaining
a panic atmosphere.

1422
01:11:47,615 --> 01:11:50,111
That atmosphere
is not justified.

1423
01:11:50,744 --> 01:11:53,287
Many of us were told
in private conversations

1424
01:11:53,322 --> 01:11:55,651
that if we voted
against this bill,

1425
01:11:56,142 --> 01:11:59,632
on Monday
that the sky would fall,

1426
01:11:59,984 --> 01:12:02,640
the market would drop two
or three thousand points the first day,

1427
01:12:02,675 --> 01:12:04,324
another couple thousand
the second day,

1428
01:12:04,845 --> 01:12:06,944
and a few members
were even told

1429
01:12:06,979 --> 01:12:11,040
that there would be martial law
in America if we voted "no".

1430
01:12:11,723 --> 01:12:15,499
That's what I call fear mongering.
Unjustified.

1431
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:18,675
The final version of the bill
was kept secret from the Congress

1432
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:22,415
until minutes before the vote
on October 3rd, 2008.

1433
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:25,990
The Federal Reserve
had promised total transparency,

1434
01:12:26,372 --> 01:12:28,626
that every dime
would be accounted for.

1435
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:33,054
To Democrats and Republicans
who've opposed this plan,

1436
01:12:33,571 --> 01:12:36,329
I say,
step up to the plate,

1437
01:12:36,534 --> 01:12:39,157
let's do what's right
for the country at this time

1438
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:42,072
because the time to act
is now.

1439
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,588
...to prevent
the possibility of a crisis,

1440
01:12:46,017 --> 01:12:47,822
turning into
a catastrophe.

1441
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,792
After its passage,
the public learned with horror

1442
01:12:52,827 --> 01:12:55,913
that the bill
was really a financial coup d'etat

1443
01:12:55,948 --> 01:12:57,102
by Wall Street.

1444
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,340
The bill didn't just give
700 billion dollars to the banks.

1445
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:02,885
It was a blank check.

1446
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:05,669
And as of
February, 2009,

1447
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:09,883
$9.7 trillion has disappeared
into a black hole.

1448
01:13:11,173 --> 01:13:13,577
Within 24 hours
of its passage,

1449
01:13:13,612 --> 01:13:16,201
Secretary of Treasury
Henry Paulson said,

1450
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:17,943
they were no longer
going to use the money

1451
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:20,693
to unfreeze the mortgage market
by buying bad debt.

1452
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,070
We went to Congress.

1453
01:13:23,423 --> 01:13:26,010
Illiquid assets looked like
the way to go.

1454
01:13:26,045 --> 01:13:28,973
As the situation worsened,
the facts changed.

1455
01:13:29,008 --> 01:13:33,454
I will never apologize
for changing an approach or strategy

1456
01:13:33,489 --> 01:13:34,490
when the facts change.

1457
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:37,073
Paulson has,
in the meantime, admitted

1458
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:40,926
that the sub-prime mortgage crisis
is not the cause, really,

1459
01:13:40,961 --> 01:13:43,403
of the breakdown of the entire
world banking system

1460
01:13:43,438 --> 01:13:47,596
and the bankruptcy of most of the banks
in London and in Wall Street.

1461
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:49,769
He said,
"Oh, we're gonna buy up toxic assets

1462
01:13:49,804 --> 01:13:52,340
but we're not going to worry about
sub-prime mortgages."

1463
01:13:52,375 --> 01:13:54,056
What he's talking about
is derivatives.

1464
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:56,650
Derivatives are
the center of the crisis.

1465
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,157
He went on to say

1466
01:13:58,207 --> 01:14:00,946
that where the money going
was a secret.

1467
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:05,717
"I believe that banking institutions
are more dangerous

1468
01:14:05,752 --> 01:14:07,614
to our liberties
than standing armies.

1469
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,488
If the American people
ever allow private banks

1470
01:14:10,523 --> 01:14:12,656
to control the issuance
of their currency,

1471
01:14:12,691 --> 01:14:15,716
first by inflation,
then by deflation,

1472
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:19,080
the banks and corporations
that will grow up around the banks

1473
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:21,565
will deprive
the people of all property

1474
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,767
until their children
wake up homeless

1475
01:14:23,798 --> 01:14:26,059
on the continent
their fathers conquered.

1476
01:14:26,344 --> 01:14:29,493
The issuing power
should be taken from the banks

1477
01:14:29,528 --> 01:14:33,419
and restored to the people,
to whom it properly belongs."

1478
01:14:33,454 --> 01:14:37,225
-- Thomas Jefferson,
third President of the United States.

1479
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,700
Secretary Paulson came in

1480
01:14:38,730 --> 01:14:42,148
with the Vice President
and Fed Chairman Bernanke

1481
01:14:42,183 --> 01:14:46,428
and made all these assurances
that there was absolutely

1482
01:14:46,467 --> 01:14:48,946
a critical,
immediate need

1483
01:14:48,981 --> 01:14:53,714
to get rid of the corrosive,
derivative products.

1484
01:14:53,749 --> 01:14:56,360
You know, all the different names,
for this, em...

1485
01:14:56,360 --> 01:15:02,558
you know, ubiquitous, you know, uh,
sub-S retraded credit default swap,

1486
01:15:02,593 --> 01:15:04,500
blah, blah, blah, blah,
okay.

1487
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,049
But they, they talked about them
as though they knew

1488
01:15:07,084 --> 01:15:08,635
what the hell
they were.

1489
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:12,540
You got the money
and you immediately said,

1490
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:16,235
"What items?
What auction?"

1491
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,642
Now the Treasury just, just basically
cut that out of the bill.

1492
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:22,649
And what, you know,
what we have here

1493
01:15:23,061 --> 01:15:26,679
is a situation
where banks are,

1494
01:15:26,714 --> 01:15:30,293
are hoarding the money
that they're getting from the TARP.

1495
01:15:30,328 --> 01:15:32,329
They're using the money
to purchase other banks.

1496
01:15:32,430 --> 01:15:36,041
And all of a sudden,
the Treasury sent a signal to the banks,

1497
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:37,315
"Forget about it.

1498
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:38,853
We're gonna give you
the money that you want,

1499
01:15:38,888 --> 01:15:40,097
and you do
what you want with it."

1500
01:15:40,132 --> 01:15:44,218
Unless you direct it specifically,
it's not gonna happen.

1501
01:15:44,317 --> 01:15:48,606
I don't think anyone questions,
Mr. Kashkari,

1502
01:15:49,464 --> 01:15:51,148
that you're working hard.

1503
01:15:52,170 --> 01:15:55,803
Our question is,
"Who are you working for?"

1504
01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:59,520
Throughout its passage,
President Bush and Senator Obama

1505
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,343
worked in tandem
to get Congress to pass the bill,

1506
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,637
without even having time
to read it.

1507
01:16:04,672 --> 01:16:07,999
Despite the fact,
that in major polls,

1508
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:11,834
98% of the American people
were against the bill,

1509
01:16:11,869 --> 01:16:14,542
the leadership in both parties
were for it.

1510
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,265
And I really want
to commend Barack Obama

1511
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,630
because as
we were involved in the...

1512
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:22,280
this and that, and
different provisions of the bill

1513
01:16:22,315 --> 01:16:26,169
to persuade people,
he really gave them confidence

1514
01:16:26,204 --> 01:16:27,964
that this was
the right decision

1515
01:16:28,485 --> 01:16:31,567
for the American people,
even though it wasn't,

1516
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:35,738
in our view, a great bill, uh,
for them to vote on.

1517
01:16:35,773 --> 01:16:37,130
I want to take
a particular moment

1518
01:16:37,237 --> 01:16:39,344
to also thank an individual
who's not here,

1519
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:42,115
and that is Barack Obama,
who made numerous calls,

1520
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:43,312
not only
to all of us,

1521
01:16:43,347 --> 01:16:44,795
but to members
of our caucus,

1522
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,741
and helped us gather the votes
on the Democratic side

1523
01:16:46,776 --> 01:16:48,551
to pass this legislation.

1524
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:51,896
Bankheads then
bragged to the press

1525
01:16:51,931 --> 01:16:53,941
that they were hoarding
the bailout money

1526
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:56,136
and using it to buy up
smaller, healthy banks

1527
01:16:56,171 --> 01:16:57,691
and insurance companies.

1528
01:16:57,726 --> 01:17:00,184
Their plan was working
like a charm.

1529
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:05,702
Next, the central bankers loaned
the Federal Government back

1530
01:17:05,737 --> 01:17:10,328
787 billion dollars
of our own money, at interest,

1531
01:17:10,363 --> 01:17:14,042
for President Obama's so-called
stimulus package.

1532
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:22,674
And just like the banker bailout,
Congress was given less than an hour

1533
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:27,048
to read the 1,070 page-plus
stimulus bill.

1534
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:30,960
Barack Obama, who had pledged
on the campaign trail

1535
01:17:30,995 --> 01:17:33,723
to wait five days before a bill
could be voted on

1536
01:17:33,758 --> 01:17:37,111
so that the Congress and the people
could have a chance to read it,

1537
01:17:37,146 --> 01:17:39,063
said that the stimulus
was too important

1538
01:17:39,064 --> 01:17:40,381
and it had
to be passed

1539
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:43,120
before anybody
could see it or read it,

1540
01:17:43,155 --> 01:17:45,908
or the crisis would turn
into a catastrophe.

1541
01:17:45,943 --> 01:17:50,520
Doing little, or nothing at all,
will result in even greater deficits,

1542
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:55,579
even greater job loss,
even greater loss of income,

1543
01:17:56,018 --> 01:17:58,575
and even
greater loss of confidence.

1544
01:17:59,124 --> 01:18:01,384
Those are deficits
that could turn a crisis

1545
01:18:01,419 --> 01:18:04,234
into a catastrophe
and I refuse to let that happen.

1546
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:08,210
After its Friday passage,
in gangster fashion,

1547
01:18:08,245 --> 01:18:11,482
President Barack Obama
took a four day vacation

1548
01:18:11,517 --> 01:18:13,898
and said that
there was no rush to sign it.

1549
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:20,166
The spending bill
was really a takeover bill

1550
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:22,924
designed to further
federalize the States

1551
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:27,269
and to pay off rich donors
that had donated to both parties.

1552
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:32,084
As the world slid
deeper into depression,

1553
01:18:32,264 --> 01:18:36,529
the bankers celebrated the fire sale
that they had created.

1554
01:18:36,564 --> 01:18:40,722
I believe this, the phrase,
"burdens of the office", is overstated.

1555
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:42,762
Yes, Kelly.

1556
01:18:42,797 --> 01:18:46,417
Why me?
Oh, the burdens.

1557
01:18:47,031 --> 01:18:50,293
Why did the financial collapse
have to happen on my watch?

1558
01:18:50,328 --> 01:18:52,818
It's just pathetic, isn't it,
self-pity?

1559
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:55,470
And I don't believe,
uh...

1560
01:18:56,011 --> 01:18:58,466
President-elect Obama
will be full of self-pity.

1561
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:02,220
With their access
to unlimited fiat capital,

1562
01:19:02,255 --> 01:19:05,721
they could now buy up
sectors of the world economy

1563
01:19:05,756 --> 01:19:08,190
not already
controlled by them.

1564
01:19:08,573 --> 01:19:12,505
For over a century,
the Anglo-American establishment

1565
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:15,363
had worked to bring
the world system to this point:

1566
01:19:15,854 --> 01:19:19,407
artificially-engineered
global bankruptcy.

1567
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:22,024
In an address
before the Trilateral Commission,

1568
01:19:22,059 --> 01:19:24,264
in June of 1991,

1569
01:19:24,299 --> 01:19:27,866
David Rockefeller
laid out the elites' ultimate goal.

1570
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,219
The supernational sovereignty

1571
01:19:30,249 --> 01:19:32,478
of an intellectual elite
and world bankers

1572
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:35,631
is surely preferable
to the national auto-determination

1573
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:37,356
practiced in
the last centuries.

1574
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:42,442
Now that the bankers
were holding the world hostage,

1575
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:44,219
they issued their ultimatum.

1576
01:19:44,254 --> 01:19:47,521
The only solution
to restart the global economy

1577
01:19:47,556 --> 01:19:50,209
would be to set up
a planetary government

1578
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:53,338
ruled by
a new Bank of The World,

1579
01:19:53,493 --> 01:19:57,191
a Bank of The World,
owned and controlled by them.

1580
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:00,432
Suddenly,
hundreds of prominent publications

1581
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:01,660
announced the solution,

1582
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:04,353
the people's only salvation.

1583
01:20:04,388 --> 01:20:07,670
Time magazine, in an article titled
<i>The New World Order</i>,

1584
01:20:07,705 --> 01:20:10,522
said that the new superbank
would control the world's currencies

1585
01:20:10,557 --> 01:20:13,462
and set interest rates
and that the new bank would, quote,

1586
01:20:13,497 --> 01:20:17,638
"Knock the heads of bad countries
like the United States."

1587
01:20:20,303 --> 01:20:23,619
At a meeting of central bankheads
and finance ministers

1588
01:20:23,654 --> 01:20:25,188
dubbed
<i>Bretton Woods II</i>,

1589
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:28,110
the plan for world government
was unveiled

1590
01:20:28,145 --> 01:20:31,688
by the very bankers
that had engineered the collapse.

1591
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,689
Formerly sovereign countries,
would now pay their taxes

1592
01:20:35,724 --> 01:20:37,899
directly
to the banking cartel.

1593
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,398
Hundreds
of new carbon taxes,

1594
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:43,277
controlling every facet
of human activity,

1595
01:20:43,312 --> 01:20:45,204
would only be
the beginning.

1596
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:50,447
Now, all the elite had to do
was to sell the public

1597
01:20:50,482 --> 01:20:53,297
on accepting the final phase
of their takeover,

1598
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:56,381
and it's Obama's job
to sucker the public,

1599
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,842
in to standing down,

1600
01:20:57,877 --> 01:21:01,103
so the bankers agenda
can move forward unhindered.

1601
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,677
Never before in US history

1602
01:21:05,712 --> 01:21:08,225
has the media gotten
behind a president,

1603
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,085
like they are
behind Obama.

1604
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:12,774
The press has pulled out
all the stops,

1605
01:21:12,809 --> 01:21:16,237
bestowing a crown of
infallibility upon Obama,

1606
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:18,008
as the savior
of the people.

1607
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,343
The elite are betting everything
they've got on Obama's charisma

1608
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,562
and hoping that
he can sell the world

1609
01:21:24,597 --> 01:21:26,136
on their program
of tyranny.

1610
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:30,691
Yes, there have been differences
between America and Europe.

1611
01:21:31,668 --> 01:21:34,185
No doubt, there will be differences
in the future.

1612
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:39,925
But the burdens of global citizenship
continue to bind us together.

1613
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,507
A change of leadership
in Washington

1614
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:45,103
will not
lift this burden.

1615
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:48,707
In this new century,
Americans and Europeans alike,

1616
01:21:48,876 --> 01:21:52,148
will be required
to do more, not less.

1617
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:57,075
Partnership and cooperation
among nations is not a choice.

1618
01:21:57,970 --> 01:21:59,284
It is the only way.

1619
01:21:59,768 --> 01:22:01,264
We've got
to give them a stake

1620
01:22:01,299 --> 01:22:03,759
in creating the kind of, uh,
world order

1621
01:22:03,794 --> 01:22:05,325
that I think
all of us would like to see.

1622
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,851
In truth,
Obama is not simply continuing

1623
01:22:08,886 --> 01:22:11,000
George W. Bush's policies.

1624
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,184
He is radically
expanding them.

1625
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,474
I thank President Bush
for his service to our nation.

1626
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,629
This film has documented
the painful fact

1627
01:22:20,664 --> 01:22:24,069
that Barack Obama's agenda
is the complete opposite

1628
01:22:24,104 --> 01:22:25,719
of what
he has claimed it to be.

1629
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:31,851
Now, we will reveal what Barack Obama
and his controllers' true agenda is.

1630
01:22:33,551 --> 01:22:34,673
Number one:

1631
01:22:34,708 --> 01:22:36,163
Bring the United States

1632
01:22:36,198 --> 01:22:38,412
under the complete
regulatory control

1633
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:42,283
of a private, offshore superbank
known as the Bank of the World.

1634
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:49,330
More than a hundred new taxes
are now being developed

1635
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:52,543
under the umbrella
of curbing greenhouse gases.

1636
01:22:52,578 --> 01:22:56,134
The new taxes will be paid directly
to the private bank consortium.

1637
01:22:56,285 --> 01:22:58,887
At the producer level,
taxes will be paid

1638
01:22:58,922 --> 01:23:00,875
on farm animals' flatulence.

1639
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:03,755
At the consumer level,
there will be carbon taxes

1640
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:05,260
on all forms of meat:

1641
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,031
beef, poultry,
pork and fish.

1642
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:11,874
All cars will be fitted
with satellite tracking boxes

1643
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:13,919
that will tax driving
by the mile.

1644
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:17,283
And an added tax will be placed
on all fossil fuels

1645
01:23:17,318 --> 01:23:19,753
including motor oil
and natural gas.

1646
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:22,643
All plastic products
will have a carbon tax added.

1647
01:23:22,678 --> 01:23:26,308
Outdoor space heaters and fireplaces
are to be taxed.

1648
01:23:26,343 --> 01:23:28,917
All electricity
produced by coal-powered plants,

1649
01:23:28,952 --> 01:23:30,185
will be taxed.

1650
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:32,069
Under
the cap-and-trade system,

1651
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:34,462
citizens will be forced
to pay taxes

1652
01:23:34,493 --> 01:23:38,428
on thousands of products
to private cap-and-trade services

1653
01:23:38,463 --> 01:23:41,256
owned by Al Gore
and other elitists.

1654
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:44,518
There will be taxes
on light bulbs, water,

1655
01:23:44,576 --> 01:23:48,200
trash pickup,
air travel, train travel.

1656
01:23:48,235 --> 01:23:55,316
Bus, ship, medicine, steel production,
mining, clothing, laundry, asphalt,

1657
01:23:55,351 --> 01:23:57,806
are just a few of the new taxes
to be levied.

1658
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,357
But to truly
transform our economy,

1659
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:03,139
to protect our security
and save our planet

1660
01:24:03,174 --> 01:24:04,953
from the ravages
of climate change,

1661
01:24:04,988 --> 01:24:08,499
we need to ultimately make
clean, renewable energy.

1662
01:24:08,534 --> 01:24:10,712
The profitable
kind of energy.

1663
01:24:10,747 --> 01:24:13,713
So I ask this Congress
to send me legislation

1664
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,963
that places a market-based cap
on carbon pollution

1665
01:24:16,998 --> 01:24:20,788
and drives the production
of more renewable energy in America.

1666
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,974
That's what we need.

1667
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:29,965
The notion of
anthropogenic global warming

1668
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,438
is a fraud.
In other words,

1669
01:24:31,473 --> 01:24:33,604
the idea that
the planet is getting warmer,

1670
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:36,555
and that human activity
is somehow responsible,

1671
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:39,256
is a pseudoscientific fraud.

1672
01:24:39,291 --> 01:24:42,331
It's a big lie.
It's a monstrosity.

1673
01:24:42,366 --> 01:24:46,775
Remember the Nazis:
They had race science, race hygiene.

1674
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:50,249
They said Aryan blood is different
from any other kind of blood.

1675
01:24:50,284 --> 01:24:54,626
This was, of course, idiocy,
a fantastic piece of nonsense.

1676
01:24:54,661 --> 01:24:56,620
Today,
we've got something similar.

1677
01:24:56,655 --> 01:24:59,410
Global warming
caused by human activity.

1678
01:24:59,445 --> 01:25:03,334
And the answer to that is carbon tax,
plus cap-and-trade,

1679
01:25:03,369 --> 01:25:06,545
according to the wishes of
Al Gore, Prince Charles,

1680
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:10,711
and basically the entire
world banking community,

1681
01:25:10,746 --> 01:25:11,938
the world oligarchy.

1682
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:16,132
What they're trying to do with that
is to perpetuate the current system

1683
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:18,983
where bankers rule the world,
financiers rule the world,

1684
01:25:19,018 --> 01:25:21,721
and the rest of us
get the crumbs from the table.

1685
01:25:21,756 --> 01:25:26,516
But remember, if you try to put on
cap-and-trade and a global warming,

1686
01:25:26,551 --> 01:25:31,460
carbon tax with the idea
that you're gonna save the polar bears,

1687
01:25:31,495 --> 01:25:35,333
what you're gonna do is
destroy human society.

1688
01:25:35,368 --> 01:25:38,281
You're gonna cause
genocide on a massive scale.

1689
01:25:38,316 --> 01:25:40,834
The deaths will be measured
in the hundreds of millions,

1690
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:42,509
and indeed,
in the billions.

1691
01:25:42,544 --> 01:25:45,108
Just the idea of global warming
means that there'll be

1692
01:25:45,143 --> 01:25:46,645
no development for Africa,

1693
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,574
no development for
the poorer parts of Southeast Asia,

1694
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:52,946
and no world economic recovery
of any kind, <i>ever</i>,

1695
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,319
in our entire lifetime.

1696
01:25:54,354 --> 01:25:57,099
So, it's important
to expose and fight

1697
01:25:57,134 --> 01:25:59,633
the pseudoscientific fraud
of global warming.

1698
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,004
One more point
about this.

1699
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:05,285
You don't need a climatologist
to know that this stuff is a fraud.

1700
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,600
I'm a historian.

1701
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,981
I can tell you,
in the last thousand years,

1702
01:26:10,016 --> 01:26:12,883
we had a period of
very warm temperatures

1703
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:15,357
called the
<i>Medieval Warm Period</i>,

1704
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:19,121
where all kinds of grapes,
and, uh, semi-tropical stuff

1705
01:26:19,156 --> 01:26:21,832
were growing very far
into the Northern Hemisphere.

1706
01:26:21,867 --> 01:26:24,061
That was
about 1100, 1200.

1707
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:31,583
It happened to correspond
with an all-time maximum of sunspots.

1708
01:26:31,618 --> 01:26:36,761
Right now, we can say that
we're going into another maximum period,

1709
01:26:36,796 --> 01:26:37,690
where there'll be
some warming,

1710
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:42,313
but we're well within the limits
of the Medieval Warm Period.

1711
01:26:42,348 --> 01:26:46,384
About 1600 to 1650,

1712
01:26:46,419 --> 01:26:49,222
there was an ice age
in Northern Europe.

1713
01:26:49,257 --> 01:26:50,837
The North Sea
was filled with ice.

1714
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,183
The German and Dutch ports
and the English ports

1715
01:26:53,218 --> 01:26:54,202
were filled with ice.

1716
01:26:54,237 --> 01:26:57,363
That corresponds
to an all-time minimum

1717
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:58,771
of sunspot activity,

1718
01:26:58,806 --> 01:27:01,100
the Sprer Minimum
and the Maunder Minimum.

1719
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,652
So, this has largely got to do
with solar activity.

1720
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:07,180
We can see that other planets,
not just the Earth,

1721
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,182
are warming slightly
as a result of increased solar activity.

1722
01:27:11,217 --> 01:27:12,942
But we're well
within the minimum.

1723
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:17,268
So, what the oligarchs claim to be
an open and shut scientific case

1724
01:27:17,308 --> 01:27:20,978
is a piece of
pseudoscientific nonsense,

1725
01:27:21,013 --> 01:27:22,751
and it should be rejected.

1726
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,300
Number two:

1727
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,650
The social engineers
are fully aware

1728
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,991
that the Obama craze
will wear off quickly,

1729
01:27:31,026 --> 01:27:32,963
so they are racing
to put in place

1730
01:27:32,998 --> 01:27:36,625
the most oppressive police
state control grid in human history.

1731
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:41,639
20,000 battle-hardened,
regular army troops

1732
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:45,666
are now being deployed to patrol
the streets of the United States.

1733
01:27:47,974 --> 01:27:50,734
FEMA is now
building giant camps

1734
01:27:50,755 --> 01:27:52,486
in every region
of the country

1735
01:27:52,526 --> 01:27:54,908
and the Congress
has introduced bills

1736
01:27:54,943 --> 01:27:59,112
like the National Emergency
Centers Act, HR 645,

1737
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:01,520
which merges local governments
and the police,

1738
01:28:01,555 --> 01:28:02,743
under federal control.

1739
01:28:04,098 --> 01:28:07,397
And as we all know,
that have watched these things,

1740
01:28:07,432 --> 01:28:10,129
they're ready
for the riots.

1741
01:28:10,512 --> 01:28:11,975
With these detention centers

1742
01:28:12,005 --> 01:28:14,163
that are being opened up
around the country,

1743
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:17,416
with state police training
for riot control,

1744
01:28:18,047 --> 01:28:22,194
in the event of economic calamity
and food riots,

1745
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,120
they know what's going on
and they're prepared for it.

1746
01:28:27,025 --> 01:28:30,689
So, people better also
prepare for it themselves.

1747
01:28:30,724 --> 01:28:33,778
Anyone that's not prepared
for what's going to happen,

1748
01:28:33,813 --> 01:28:35,314
they deserve what they get.

1749
01:28:35,349 --> 01:28:37,319
Because there's
enough information out there,

1750
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:38,844
pointing
to the problems.

1751
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,329
And they should take
all precautionary actions.

1752
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,382
Next, Obama ordered
the Defense Department

1753
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:47,760
to issue
DOD Directive 1404.10,

1754
01:28:47,795 --> 01:28:51,327
establishing a one million person
civilian army,

1755
01:28:51,362 --> 01:28:52,972
under his control.

1756
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,417
Simultaneously,
Obama launched USAService.org.

1757
01:28:57,430 --> 01:29:01,553
The new web site deceptively
masquerades as a federal agency

1758
01:29:01,588 --> 01:29:04,241
but in reality,
is a recruiting tool,

1759
01:29:04,276 --> 01:29:07,102
building a separate,
completely private army,

1760
01:29:07,137 --> 01:29:11,610
outside of government that takes orders
directly from Obama's controllers.

1761
01:29:11,645 --> 01:29:16,319
Barack Obama has refused to rescind
Presidential Decision Directive 51,

1762
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,736
signed by George W. Bush.

1763
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:20,736
The directive plainly states:

1764
01:29:20,771 --> 01:29:24,921
the President is a dictator
and that Congress is ceremonial.

1765
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:29,766
We cannot continue
to rely only on our military,

1766
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:32,405
in order to achieve
the national security objectives

1767
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:33,188
that we've set.

1768
01:29:33,698 --> 01:29:36,669
We've got to have
a civilian national security force

1769
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:41,074
that's just as powerful,
just as strong, just as well-funded.

1770
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:48,212
President Obama and
his Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel,

1771
01:29:48,247 --> 01:29:50,297
have repeatedly
stated on the record

1772
01:29:50,332 --> 01:29:52,750
that all Americans
below the age of 64,

1773
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:55,567
will be forcibly conscripted
into federal service.

1774
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,689
Citizenship is not
an entitlement program.

1775
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,935
It comes
with responsibilities.

1776
01:30:01,291 --> 01:30:03,693
Everybody somewhere
between the ages of 18-25

1777
01:30:03,728 --> 01:30:06,363
will serve three months
of basic training and understanding,

1778
01:30:06,398 --> 01:30:07,819
in a kind of civil defense.

1779
01:30:08,453 --> 01:30:12,762
Now, it doesn't always
have to be service in uniform.

1780
01:30:12,797 --> 01:30:14,898
One of the things that,
if you talk to our generals,

1781
01:30:14,933 --> 01:30:16,828
they are desperate for

1782
01:30:17,229 --> 01:30:22,306
is a civilian counterpart
to our military forces.

1783
01:30:22,341 --> 01:30:24,310
- So is this compulsory, then?
- Well...

1784
01:30:24,345 --> 01:30:27,954
You have to, in the sense
that it's required of everybody,

1785
01:30:28,334 --> 01:30:30,287
18 to 25,
three months.

1786
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:33,581
And at some point,
at that point, you do it.

1787
01:30:33,827 --> 01:30:35,170
Obviously,
I'm not gonna sit here and...

1788
01:30:35,443 --> 01:30:37,621
perfect legislation;
we'll work that process through.

1789
01:30:37,656 --> 01:30:39,119
You could do it
during a college summer.

1790
01:30:39,154 --> 01:30:40,671
- Right. I could do it any time.
- You could do after high school.

1791
01:30:40,976 --> 01:30:44,111
If you have a demagogue
with a fanatical mass movement,

1792
01:30:44,146 --> 01:30:45,486
a personality cultist,

1793
01:30:45,521 --> 01:30:48,097
who is imposing
the program of a group

1794
01:30:48,138 --> 01:30:52,712
of extreme bankers
and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.

1795
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,914
Obama's transition site, Change.gov,
proclaimed

1796
01:30:56,949 --> 01:30:59,711
that middle school and
high school students will be forced

1797
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:01,254
to serve
the Federal Government.

1798
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,724
Fascism is gutter up,
streets up:

1799
01:31:06,759 --> 01:31:10,650
hooligans, thugs,
fervently idealistic students,

1800
01:31:10,685 --> 01:31:11,945
swarming adolescents,

1801
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:14,064
just the kind of thing
you see around Obama.

1802
01:31:14,099 --> 01:31:17,321
The way you get a population
to enslave itself,

1803
01:31:17,356 --> 01:31:21,153
when the police and the army
are no longer enough to do that.

1804
01:31:21,188 --> 01:31:22,405
So I think
that's--that's...

1805
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:26,458
If you're a left liberal, uh,
it's time to open your eyes to that.

1806
01:31:26,493 --> 01:31:30,231
All young Americans
between the ages of 18 and 24

1807
01:31:30,266 --> 01:31:34,699
will be conscripted into
a paramilitary domestic security force.

1808
01:31:34,734 --> 01:31:39,534
If Obama has his way,
adults and seniors will also be forced

1809
01:31:39,569 --> 01:31:43,301
into other forms of service
for the betterment of the homeland.

1810
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,608
Number three:

1811
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,795
Disarming the American people.

1812
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:52,438
Obama operatives
in the Congress

1813
01:31:52,469 --> 01:31:54,181
have introduced
more than 10 bills

1814
01:31:54,216 --> 01:31:57,036
that would end the Second Amendment
as we know it.

1815
01:31:57,338 --> 01:32:01,293
HR-1022 would allow
the new Attorney General, Eric Holder,

1816
01:32:01,328 --> 01:32:05,294
the dictatorial power
to ban any gun he wishes at will.

1817
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:09,169
In 2008,
before the Supreme Court,

1818
01:32:09,204 --> 01:32:13,606
in the DC gun ban case,
<i>District of Columbia vs. Heller</i>,

1819
01:32:13,641 --> 01:32:17,502
Holder argued for the complete
disarmament of the American people

1820
01:32:17,537 --> 01:32:20,392
and that only the military
should own firearms.

1821
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:24,335
HR-257 would ban
all youth shooting sports,

1822
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:27,476
including YMCA and Youth Olympic
shooting clubs.

1823
01:32:29,299 --> 01:32:31,938
HR-45 would force
all gun owners

1824
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:34,493
to undergo
federal psychological screening,

1825
01:32:34,528 --> 01:32:37,910
registration and testing
to keep their firearms.

1826
01:32:39,990 --> 01:32:42,365
White House Chief of Staff,
Rahm Emanuel,

1827
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:44,526
has proposed
the extrajudicial banning

1828
01:32:44,561 --> 01:32:47,487
of any American
on the fraudulent no-fly list

1829
01:32:47,522 --> 01:32:49,172
from owning any firearm.

1830
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:51,781
That is,
if you are on the no-fly list,

1831
01:32:52,123 --> 01:32:55,061
because you are known
as maybe a possible terrorist,

1832
01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:59,016
you cannot buy
a handgun in America.

1833
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:06,461
Over 25,000 Americans are added
each month to the no-fly list,

1834
01:33:06,496 --> 01:33:08,734
which numbers
over a million people

1835
01:33:08,769 --> 01:33:11,746
who have not been
charged or convicted of any crime.

1836
01:33:12,616 --> 01:33:14,962
It's a case
of mistaken identity

1837
01:33:15,003 --> 01:33:17,653
for a five-year-old boy
from Normandy Park.

1838
01:33:17,688 --> 01:33:21,232
He had trouble boarding a plane
because someone with his same name

1839
01:33:21,267 --> 01:33:22,995
is wanted
by the Federal Government.

1840
01:33:23,218 --> 01:33:26,413
KING-5's Mimi Jung is live
at SeaTac Airport to explain.

1841
01:33:26,448 --> 01:33:27,136
Mimi...

1842
01:33:27,171 --> 01:33:29,156
Laurie, it's hard to believe
that a five-year-old

1843
01:33:29,191 --> 01:33:30,739
could be considered a threat,

1844
01:33:30,774 --> 01:33:33,265
but that's exactly what happened
here at SeaTac, last week,

1845
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,455
when Matthew Gardner
showed up for a flight to LAX.

1846
01:33:39,108 --> 01:33:40,452
And they are fighting each other...

1847
01:33:40,487 --> 01:33:43,063
As five-year-olds go,
Matthew Gardner

1848
01:33:43,098 --> 01:33:44,988
is about as harmless
as you can get.

1849
01:33:45,303 --> 01:33:48,735
But when he and his mom checked in
for their flight at SeaTac, last week,

1850
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:51,131
Matthew was considered
the criminal.

1851
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:52,570
If you're on
that no-fly list,

1852
01:33:53,243 --> 01:33:56,275
your access to the right
to bear arms is canceled,

1853
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:58,294
because you're not
part of the American family.

1854
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,878
You don't deserve
that right.

1855
01:33:59,913 --> 01:34:03,310
There is no right for you,
if you're on that terrorist list.

1856
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:06,560
And even though this Matthew Gardner
is only in kindergarten,

1857
01:34:06,783 --> 01:34:09,744
TSA workers still conducted
a full-blown search.

1858
01:34:09,779 --> 01:34:11,415
They searched
all of our belongings.

1859
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:13,509
They took everything apart,
piece-by-piece.

1860
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:16,596
Nadia Counter says
it wasn't easy being treated

1861
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:19,020
as a possible threat
to national security.

1862
01:34:19,055 --> 01:34:21,376
I picked up my child to give him a hug
and tell him, you know,

1863
01:34:21,411 --> 01:34:22,424
"It's okay,
we're doing fine,"

1864
01:34:22,444 --> 01:34:24,662
and they reported to me
that I was not allowed to touch him,

1865
01:34:24,697 --> 01:34:26,380
he was
a security risk,

1866
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,550
and they had to re-search me
to make sure that

1867
01:34:29,551 --> 01:34:32,258
I had not obtained
any materials from him.

1868
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:33,428
Number four:

1869
01:34:33,463 --> 01:34:36,518
Massive restrictions on
the First Amendment guarantee

1870
01:34:36,553 --> 01:34:37,500
of free speech.

1871
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:42,335
The President, Congress, and the FCC,
have announced plans

1872
01:34:42,370 --> 01:34:45,539
to not only curtail speech
on talk radio and newspapers,

1873
01:34:45,574 --> 01:34:48,096
but to also regulate speech
on the Internet,

1874
01:34:48,131 --> 01:34:50,709
through the Orwellian named
<i>Fairness Doctrine</i>.

1875
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:55,184
The Obama machine
is also pressuring Congress

1876
01:34:55,219 --> 01:34:57,833
to pass draconian
hate speech laws

1877
01:34:57,868 --> 01:35:00,010
that will eviscerate
the First Amendment.

1878
01:35:00,641 --> 01:35:01,609
Number five:

1879
01:35:01,644 --> 01:35:04,139
They plan to further
federalize healthcare

1880
01:35:04,174 --> 01:35:05,949
so that the government
can dictate

1881
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,051
what kind of care
citizens receive.

1882
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:12,692
Modeled after the British System,
this includes rationing care

1883
01:35:12,722 --> 01:35:14,879
and restricting
what procedures

1884
01:35:14,909 --> 01:35:18,120
the handicapped and elderly
are eligible for.

1885
01:35:21,628 --> 01:35:22,712
Number six:

1886
01:35:22,747 --> 01:35:24,662
Obama
is already pushing

1887
01:35:24,693 --> 01:35:27,133
to expand the Department
of Defense budget

1888
01:35:27,172 --> 01:35:33,293
and to station more US troops overseas
to encircle Russia, China, Iran;

1889
01:35:37,584 --> 01:35:42,533
as well as setting up bases in Africa,
under the pretext of humanitarian aid,

1890
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:47,217
and dominate and occupy Africa
through AFRICOM.

1891
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,171
So we're taking
your phone calls,

1892
01:35:50,213 --> 01:35:53,241
seeing what you think of
Barack H. Obama.

1893
01:35:53,281 --> 01:35:56,055
Is he a Judas goat?
Is he a front man? Is he a betrayer?

1894
01:35:56,100 --> 01:35:57,841
Let's go to Anthony
in Georgia.

1895
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:59,965
Anthony, what's your take
on Barack Obama?

1896
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:06,802
They put the face of Barack Obama
as part of their public relations

1897
01:36:06,837 --> 01:36:09,606
because it's like the old folk tales
about vampires.

1898
01:36:09,975 --> 01:36:12,936
A vampire cannot force his way
into somebody's house.

1899
01:36:12,971 --> 01:36:15,657
It's against some kind
of metaphysical law.

1900
01:36:15,692 --> 01:36:19,651
So, the vampire has to persuade
the resident of the household

1901
01:36:19,686 --> 01:36:21,973
to open the door
and invite him in.

1902
01:36:22,008 --> 01:36:24,984
So, they're gonna look at the people,
at Barack Obama,

1903
01:36:25,019 --> 01:36:27,451
which looks like them
and appears to be on their side.

1904
01:36:27,609 --> 01:36:28,450
They're gonna say,

1905
01:36:28,531 --> 01:36:31,039
"Okay, here's my ally,
let me open the door

1906
01:36:31,074 --> 01:36:33,231
and let me let, uh,
this person in."

1907
01:36:33,266 --> 01:36:35,374
And then, Barack Obama,
who's just, of course,

1908
01:36:35,409 --> 01:36:37,448
a front man
for the American Empire,

1909
01:36:37,483 --> 01:36:39,958
where he's gonna have
the entire US Navy,

1910
01:36:39,993 --> 01:36:42,655
the entire US Army,
and the entire US Marines,

1911
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:44,575
under AFRICOM Command.

1912
01:36:44,610 --> 01:36:47,437
And, of course,
he's gonna turn it into a new Iraq

1913
01:36:47,472 --> 01:36:49,173
and he's gonna turn it
into a new Afghanistan.

1914
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:51,254
Everything,
every operation that you see

1915
01:36:51,255 --> 01:36:52,683
going on in
Iraq and Afghanistan,

1916
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,892
is going to propagate
to the poor countries of Africa.

1917
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,067
- And, it's a shame.
- Well sir, sir, I agree with you.

1918
01:36:59,102 --> 01:37:00,093
Sir, I agree with you.

1919
01:37:00,128 --> 01:37:01,200
They're looking
to the people,

1920
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:04,053
they see
a handsome, smiling African face.

1921
01:37:04,355 --> 01:37:06,198
You know, he's all,
"Hey, I'm from Kenya."

1922
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,155
And then,
it's a total bait-and-switch.

1923
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:09,713
But it's the same thing here
in the United States,

1924
01:37:09,748 --> 01:37:11,249
where they
would get... sellout...

1925
01:37:11,987 --> 01:37:15,140
Native American Chiefs
to sell out their people.

1926
01:37:15,175 --> 01:37:17,347
- This is the oldest trick in the book.
- Right.

1927
01:37:18,085 --> 01:37:19,833
And he can also pacify

1928
01:37:20,727 --> 01:37:23,364
the most downtrodden minority groups
in the United States.

1929
01:37:23,399 --> 01:37:24,928
So he's saying,
"Hey, get ready for sacrifice.

1930
01:37:24,968 --> 01:37:26,500
Get ready to lose
your standard of living."

1931
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:28,300
They're like,
"Yeah, I love Obama."

1932
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:31,119
They could never get away with this
with a John McCain.

1933
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:33,742
Obama basically does
a couple of things.

1934
01:37:33,777 --> 01:37:36,600
One is, again, this idea:
Kick the Chinese out of Africa.

1935
01:37:36,635 --> 01:37:38,286
Kick them out of Sudan
where they get oil.

1936
01:37:38,321 --> 01:37:40,630
Kick them out of Zimbabwe
were they get raw materials.

1937
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:45,230
Start a civil war in Congo,
another big source of raw materials.

1938
01:37:45,700 --> 01:37:48,791
Al-Qaeda, an arm of
the US intelligence community,

1939
01:37:48,826 --> 01:37:52,375
is now active in
Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco.

1940
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:56,430
You've got a destabilization going on
in Kenya, around Odinga.

1941
01:37:56,465 --> 01:37:57,967
That's Obama's cousin.

1942
01:37:58,002 --> 01:38:00,746
This is a guy
who has two children.

1943
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:04,680
They're Obama's niece and, well,
nephew, in a broad sense,

1944
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,083
and one of them is named Raoul
and the other one is named Winnie,

1945
01:38:08,118 --> 01:38:10,759
after Winnie Mandela
who did the necklacing

1946
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:13,871
and political assassinations
in South Africa.

1947
01:38:13,906 --> 01:38:19,608
So this Odinga is essentially
a CIA destabilizing operation in Kenya.

1948
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:25,761
And he's got a Odinga Islamic Alliance
to crush the Christians in Kenya.

1949
01:38:25,796 --> 01:38:28,518
But this also reaches
into Ethiopia.

1950
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:31,671
It reaches into
Uganda, Congo, Tanzania,

1951
01:38:31,706 --> 01:38:33,971
and a whole bunch
of other countries in that region.

1952
01:38:34,006 --> 01:38:37,578
So, all of Africa
is a battlefield in flames,

1953
01:38:37,613 --> 01:38:39,201
between the US
and the Chinese,

1954
01:38:39,236 --> 01:38:42,031
with Obama leading the charge
to kick the Chinese out

1955
01:38:42,066 --> 01:38:43,775
for geopolitical reasons.

1956
01:38:43,810 --> 01:38:44,900
Number seven:

1957
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:48,740
Radically expand federal control
over family farms and ranches

1958
01:38:48,780 --> 01:38:51,570
through the animal ID
and premises ID system.

1959
01:38:52,508 --> 01:38:53,473
Number eight:

1960
01:38:53,508 --> 01:38:55,853
Accelerate the merger
of the United States

1961
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:57,270
with Canada and Mexico,

1962
01:38:57,305 --> 01:38:59,861
under the Security
and Prosperity Partnership.

1963
01:39:00,130 --> 01:39:04,766
He is also accelerating the transfer
of remaining federal authority

1964
01:39:04,801 --> 01:39:09,131
to unelected quasi-governmental bodies
like the World Trade Organization.

1965
01:39:11,063 --> 01:39:12,286
Number nine:

1966
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:15,558
Obama must convincingly play
the part of the President

1967
01:39:15,609 --> 01:39:18,368
and convince the people
of the United States

1968
01:39:18,403 --> 01:39:20,608
that the buck actually
stops with him.

1969
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,182
This is critical
to the globalist master plan,

1970
01:39:24,217 --> 01:39:26,194
because in 4 to 8 years,

1971
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:29,157
Obama must take the blame,
as Bush did,

1972
01:39:29,192 --> 01:39:31,712
for the New World Order's
horrific agenda.

1973
01:39:31,747 --> 01:39:33,876
At that point, the elite will put
a new puppet

1974
01:39:33,911 --> 01:39:35,793
in the ceremonial seat
of power

1975
01:39:35,828 --> 01:39:39,460
and build him up as the savior,
only to tear them down again.

1976
01:39:39,495 --> 01:39:43,053
And so the process is repeated,
over and over.

1977
01:39:44,575 --> 01:39:46,031
For their program
to work,

1978
01:39:46,083 --> 01:39:48,431
it is essential
that the people not learn

1979
01:39:48,466 --> 01:39:51,642
that the presidency is now
nothing more than theater.

1980
01:39:51,677 --> 01:39:52,961
Because if they did,

1981
01:39:53,013 --> 01:39:55,701
the people would stop looking
at the pawns,

1982
01:39:55,736 --> 01:39:57,526
and start looking
for the king.

1983
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,400
Through this system of deceit,
the elites' criminal agenda

1984
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,957
can continue forever
because the people waste

1985
01:40:05,992 --> 01:40:09,665
all of their political energy,
debating the media spectacle,

1986
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,605
instead of investigating
the globalist agenda.

1987
01:40:14,156 --> 01:40:15,094
Number ten:

1988
01:40:15,129 --> 01:40:17,579
It's Obama's job
to sell the public

1989
01:40:17,614 --> 01:40:19,223
on globalist policies

1990
01:40:19,258 --> 01:40:21,411
that aren't in
the people's best interest.

1991
01:40:21,446 --> 01:40:24,039
But the overlords
have many salesmen.

1992
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:27,137
His most important function

1993
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:30,850
is to protect the criminal oligarchs
from prosecution

1994
01:40:30,885 --> 01:40:33,136
while they loot
the economy worldwide,

1995
01:40:33,318 --> 01:40:36,148
start new wars,
and engage in torture.

1996
01:40:38,628 --> 01:40:40,181
They're called
<i>Generation O</i>

1997
01:40:40,221 --> 01:40:43,817
and they were the key
to Barack Obama's White House win.

1998
01:40:43,852 --> 01:40:45,899
Yes we can, can, can.

1999
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:48,308
During the campaign,
Barack Obama used the Internet,

2000
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:49,820
like no other candidate
before him,

2001
01:40:49,855 --> 01:40:52,157
harnessing the energy of millions
of his supporters.

2002
01:40:52,192 --> 01:40:53,444
But the question now is,

2003
01:40:53,763 --> 01:40:56,893
what to do with this young,
eager, energetic army.

2004
01:40:57,270 --> 01:40:59,355
This gives Barack Obama
and his administration

2005
01:40:59,395 --> 01:41:01,706
contact information
for so many people.

2006
01:41:01,741 --> 01:41:04,123
So, next time,
he needs to push his legislation,

2007
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:05,714
he can contact
all these people.

2008
01:41:05,749 --> 01:41:07,431
Kennedy-esque.

2009
01:41:07,741 --> 01:41:11,631
I feel as though this was like
when John F. Kennedy was elected.

2010
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:14,199
Shouting, smiles,
and tears.

2011
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:17,568
Oh, my God!
This is the best day of my life.

2012
01:41:17,603 --> 01:41:21,224
It was the scope of Obama's victory
that was most impressive.

2013
01:41:25,165 --> 01:41:27,441
I saw a photograph

2014
01:41:27,933 --> 01:41:30,719
of Obama playing basketball.
And I said,

2015
01:41:30,754 --> 01:41:33,433
"You know what?
I see him as a leader,

2016
01:41:33,686 --> 01:41:37,203
and that's the world
that's in his hands."

2017
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:38,543
Own a piece of history,

2018
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:41,543
commemorating the day
the world changed forever.

2019
01:41:41,578 --> 01:41:45,699
His confident smile and kind eyes
are an inspiration to us all.

2020
01:41:46,821 --> 01:41:51,358
In summation, Barack Obama
is a Madison Avenue-created fad.

2021
01:41:51,765 --> 01:41:54,011
All of
the crazed Obama worship

2022
01:41:54,222 --> 01:41:56,409
being pushed
by the corporate media

2023
01:41:56,444 --> 01:41:59,357
is scientifically designed
to capture the public

2024
01:41:59,392 --> 01:42:02,188
in a net of peer-pressure
mass euphoria.

2025
01:42:03,885 --> 01:42:07,618
If the New World Order
can just distract the public

2026
01:42:07,653 --> 01:42:09,119
for a few more years,

2027
01:42:09,154 --> 01:42:12,552
the elite can finish constructing
their police state control grid.

2028
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:18,921
Now, a lot of times,
we don't want to know the issue.

2029
01:42:18,956 --> 01:42:19,604
Right.

2030
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,375
We don't want
to know the issue.

2031
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:22,248
We feel...

2032
01:42:22,809 --> 01:42:23,985
What do you call
this thing

2033
01:42:24,046 --> 01:42:26,314
where you get this false sense
of gratification,

2034
01:42:26,349 --> 01:42:29,761
but because a black man is in office,
everything's goin' be alright?

2035
01:42:29,796 --> 01:42:31,663
No, everything's
not goin' be all right.

2036
01:42:31,698 --> 01:42:32,300
Yeah.

2037
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:35,326
Until you look into the agenda
on what the Democratic Party

2038
01:42:35,361 --> 01:42:39,216
has been about, is about,
and will be about,

2039
01:42:39,251 --> 01:42:42,311
regardless if Barack Obama's
the president or not.

2040
01:42:42,346 --> 01:42:43,007
And that's real.

2041
01:42:43,083 --> 01:42:46,741
Barack Obama
is the perfect Trojan horse.

2042
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:50,573
He makes the people feel like
they finally have a place at the table,

2043
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:52,681
even as he betrays them.

2044
01:42:52,914 --> 01:42:54,945
I won't have to worry about
paying my mortgage.

2045
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:57,291
Oh, it's such a blessing to see you,
Mr. President.

2046
01:42:57,326 --> 01:42:59,308
Thank you for taking time
out of your day.

2047
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:04,067
Never, in my life, would think
that this would ever happen.

2048
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:09,636
Sadly, many Obama supporters can't see
what's right in front of their faces

2049
01:43:09,685 --> 01:43:12,749
because they've already invested
their very identity

2050
01:43:12,899 --> 01:43:16,047
in this artificially-created
cult movement.

2051
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,790
Throughout history,
it has happened over and over again.

2052
01:43:23,041 --> 01:43:24,699
People turn their intellect

2053
01:43:24,810 --> 01:43:27,903
over to cult-of-personality
mass movements,

2054
01:43:27,938 --> 01:43:29,392
and it's happening again.

2055
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:34,922
The evidence presented
in this film is documented fact,

2056
01:43:34,957 --> 01:43:37,670
and those that ignore
what history has taught us,

2057
01:43:37,929 --> 01:43:40,274
do so
at the peril of us all.

2058
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:44,504
As frightening as the information
in this film is,

2059
01:43:44,539 --> 01:43:46,169
there are many things
we can do

2060
01:43:46,209 --> 01:43:49,140
to stop the globalist agenda
dead in its tracks.

2061
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:54,458
First, we expose the cult of Obama
for what it is:

2062
01:43:54,493 --> 01:43:55,692
A sad hoax.

2063
01:43:56,888 --> 01:44:01,939
Next, realize that we are
all being propagandized, 24/7.

2064
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:05,989
Investigate all information
for yourself;

2065
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,812
be it political parties,
the media, or this film.

2066
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:15,349
Be aware of the tricks
that the elite use,

2067
01:44:15,384 --> 01:44:19,163
like the staging of false-flag terror attacks
and other crises.

2068
01:44:22,930 --> 01:44:26,022
Rediscover the Constitution
and Bill of Rights.

2069
01:44:26,257 --> 01:44:28,043
Promote a culture
of true liberty.

2070
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,363
There is a reason
the internationalists

2071
01:44:30,392 --> 01:44:34,037
are attempting to destroy
the sovereignty of all 50 states.

2072
01:44:34,072 --> 01:44:36,505
They know it is
one of the biggest threats

2073
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:37,608
to their domination.

2074
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:40,433
The Federal Government
has been completely hijacked

2075
01:44:40,468 --> 01:44:43,615
by foreign interests,
and more than 25 states,

2076
01:44:43,808 --> 01:44:47,904
have recognized this fact and are moving
to block the New World Order,

2077
01:44:47,939 --> 01:44:51,115
at the state level by declaring
their Tenth Amendment powers.

2078
01:44:51,459 --> 01:44:53,215
But most important of all,

2079
01:44:53,250 --> 01:44:56,847
there is a huge awakening
taking place in the United States

2080
01:44:56,882 --> 01:44:59,869
and across the world
against the globalist agenda.

2081
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:02,856
Free people everywhere
are joining together

2082
01:45:02,887 --> 01:45:05,580
in saying "No"
to corruption and tyranny,

2083
01:45:05,615 --> 01:45:07,804
and "No"
to world government.

2084
01:45:07,839 --> 01:45:13,181
This is the center of endurance,
and endurance is what wins wars.

2085
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:17,539
Not how many people you kill,
but how long can you endure.

2086
01:45:17,574 --> 01:45:21,101
George Washington lost
almost every battle he had,

2087
01:45:21,665 --> 01:45:24,237
but he endured!

2088
01:45:24,272 --> 01:45:26,558
He out-endured the British.

2089
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,376
And that's how the battle was won:
Endurance.

2090
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:33,223
And each and every one of you
watching this,

2091
01:45:33,803 --> 01:45:35,293
every single
one of you,

2092
01:45:35,328 --> 01:45:40,622
is just as important as the people
who were our founding fathers.

2093
01:45:40,657 --> 01:45:43,260
As... that you are
just as important

2094
01:45:43,330 --> 01:45:46,894
as the Sons of Liberty
who met in the 1770s

2095
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:53,254
to--to philosophize about freedom,
to philosophize about a republic,

2096
01:45:53,289 --> 01:45:58,303
to philosophize
about a truly free country

2097
01:45:58,338 --> 01:45:59,335
with a republic.

2098
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:02,025
There's a billion people
on the planet.

2099
01:46:02,363 --> 01:46:04,076
It only take one
to change it.

2100
01:46:04,842 --> 01:46:06,074
Are you the one?

2101
01:46:06,677 --> 01:46:09,637
There may be everybody
in your classroom bugging out.

2102
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,713
Your whole school
may be on fire,

2103
01:46:11,748 --> 01:46:13,765
with kids,
wild and bringing guns there.

2104
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:15,361
But are you the one?

2105
01:46:16,021 --> 01:46:18,639
Nature has
a way of abundance.

2106
01:46:18,674 --> 01:46:22,300
Nature puts out a lot of stuff,
looking for the <i>one</i>!

2107
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:26,848
So, if you're gonna go along
with the trend of,

2108
01:46:26,883 --> 01:46:32,225
"Let's just kill each other,
let's disrespect each other,"

2109
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:35,925
then you're part
of Nature's plan, as well,

2110
01:46:36,065 --> 01:46:40,253
to be part of, just the,
the, the, the excess.

2111
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:45,660
But if you think more of yourself
than just being the excess,

2112
01:46:45,695 --> 01:46:48,028
you'll do
more for yourself.

2113
01:46:48,063 --> 01:46:50,233
Are you <i>The One</i>?

2114
01:46:50,666 --> 01:46:52,714
Everybody's
not gonna make it,

2115
01:46:54,570 --> 01:46:58,397
but you have an opportunity
to save yourself.

2116
01:46:58,522 --> 01:47:02,536
Well, we don't have to look back
thousands or even hundreds of years

2117
01:47:02,571 --> 01:47:05,818
to see how dangerous
this present-day situation is.

2118
01:47:06,129 --> 01:47:08,248
We can look back
to Bolshevik Russia.

2119
01:47:08,283 --> 01:47:11,440
We can see the takeover
by the Bolsheviks,

2120
01:47:11,475 --> 01:47:13,979
talking about
the people's revolution,

2121
01:47:14,014 --> 01:47:16,234
talking about
the positive change.

2122
01:47:16,269 --> 01:47:18,486
And Lenin came in
and then Stalin.

2123
01:47:18,970 --> 01:47:24,597
The fact is, is that
over forty million Russians,

2124
01:47:24,632 --> 01:47:27,718
between
1925 and 1940,

2125
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:29,882
good Russians,
people who were Christians,

2126
01:47:29,917 --> 01:47:32,773
people who had,
who had their own businesses,

2127
01:47:32,808 --> 01:47:36,380
people who were educated;
they were exterminated,

2128
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:41,240
because they had their own business,
because they were educated,

2129
01:47:41,275 --> 01:47:44,277
because they believed,
believed in God's law.

2130
01:47:45,508 --> 01:47:47,224
We can look over
at Germany.

2131
01:47:47,259 --> 01:47:51,718
Germany was in a very,
very terrible economic situation

2132
01:47:51,778 --> 01:47:56,454
and this very charismatic leader
called Adolf Hitler comes in.

2133
01:47:56,489 --> 01:47:59,147
He, he, he makes
the roads good

2134
01:47:59,182 --> 01:48:01,436
and he promises a better life
for the people,

2135
01:48:01,988 --> 01:48:05,616
and within 10 years,
you see a completely

2136
01:48:05,651 --> 01:48:10,019
nationalized, centralized,
dictatorial situation,

2137
01:48:10,298 --> 01:48:13,789
where millions and millions of people
were exterminated.

2138
01:48:13,824 --> 01:48:17,000
And then we can go
to Maoist China.

2139
01:48:17,274 --> 01:48:18,427
Mao came in.

2140
01:48:18,462 --> 01:48:21,647
He, he, promised change,
he promised a better life,

2141
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:28,291
and within five years,
sixty million Chinese were exterminated.

2142
01:48:28,460 --> 01:48:30,903
They don't teach that,
they don't teach that

2143
01:48:30,938 --> 01:48:32,452
in the schools
these days,

2144
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,112
and it wasn't that
long ago.

2145
01:48:34,731 --> 01:48:37,872
And I pray, pray,
pray to God

2146
01:48:37,907 --> 01:48:39,848
that this will not happen
in the United States.

2147
01:48:39,883 --> 01:48:43,762
And the way it won't happen,
is if you, and your friends,

2148
01:48:43,797 --> 01:48:46,631
and all of us together,
take action to say, "No".

2149
01:48:46,666 --> 01:48:50,421
This country is too precious.
It's too wonderful.

2150
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:54,945
It--it's too good of a place
to lay down as a victim.

2151
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:56,645
Greatness could arise,

2152
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:59,551
once we break the shackles
of the government

2153
01:48:59,586 --> 01:49:00,810
that's holding us back.

2154
01:49:00,845 --> 01:49:03,519
One thing America has
more than any other country

2155
01:49:03,554 --> 01:49:05,371
is an entrepreneurial spirit.

2156
01:49:06,100 --> 01:49:08,328
One thing we have
more than any other country

2157
01:49:08,363 --> 01:49:10,270
is the ability
to be innovators.

2158
01:49:10,974 --> 01:49:12,350
You know,
if I was born in Italy,

2159
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:14,627
I wouldn't be the trend forecaster
I am today

2160
01:49:14,662 --> 01:49:16,522
because I would've been
locked into a culture

2161
01:49:16,883 --> 01:49:18,039
of thinking one way.

2162
01:49:18,370 --> 01:49:19,971
We have that
freedom of expression

2163
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:22,351
and freedom of thought
that could free us

2164
01:49:22,482 --> 01:49:24,009
to create greatness again,

2165
01:49:24,108 --> 01:49:29,286
<i>if</i>, if Big Brother
doesn't come down on us harder.

2166
01:49:30,294 --> 01:49:33,705
Humankind
is at a historic crossroads.

2167
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:35,675
The forces of globalism

2168
01:49:35,710 --> 01:49:38,514
are marching towards
absolute despotism.

2169
01:49:38,821 --> 01:49:40,737
Look in the mirror.

2170
01:49:41,047 --> 01:49:42,453
Count the cost.

2171
01:49:42,608 --> 01:49:43,661
And decide:

2172
01:49:43,781 --> 01:49:46,654

history repeat itself?

2173
01:49:47,351 --> 01:49:51,384
Or, will you stand tall
with freedom lovers everywhere

2174
01:49:51,496 --> 01:49:55,329
and stop the completion
of a world dictatorship?
